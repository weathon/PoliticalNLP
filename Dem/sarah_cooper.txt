Let me put this in my own words. I've heard Donald Trump say some pretty unhinged things. I heard them over and over and over again, but nothing is more dangerous to our democracy than his attacks on mail and voting during a pandemic. Here's the truth, Donald Trump doesn't want any of us to vote because he knows he can't win fair and square. So whether you plan to vote by mail or in person, wearing your mask, it is your vote and it's your right. Don't let Donald Trump take that away from you.
