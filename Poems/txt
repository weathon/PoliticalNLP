I had a parting glimpse of you, Monday forenoon, at your window--andthat image abides by me, looking pale, and not so quiet as is yourwont
 I have reproached myself many times since, because I did notshow my face, and then we should both have smiled; and so ourreminiscences would have been sunny instead of shadowy
 But I believeI was so intent on seeing you, that I forgot all about thedesirableness of being myself seen
 Perhaps, after all, you did seeme--at least you knew that I was there
 I fear that you were not quitewell that morning
 Do grow better and better--physically, I mean, forI protest against any spiritual improvement, until I am better able tokeep pace with you--but do be strong, and full of life--earthlylife--and let there be a glow in your cheeks
 And sleep soundly thewhole night long, and get up every morning with a feeling as if youwere newly created; and I pray you to lay up a stock of fresh energyevery day till we meet again; so that we may walk miles and miles,without your once needing to lean upon my arm
 Not but what youshall lean upon it, as much as you choose--indeed, whether youchoose or not--but I would feel as if you did it to lighten myfootsteps, not to support your own
 Am I requiring you to work amiracle within yourself? Perhaps so--yet, not a greater one than I doreally believe might be wrought by inward faith and outward aids
 Tryit, my Dove, and be as lightsome on earth as your sister doves are inthe air
Tomorrow I shall expect a letter from you; but I am almost in doubtwhether to tell you that I expect it; because then your consciencewill reproach you, if you should happen not to have written
 I wouldleave you as free as you leave me
 But I do wonder whether you wereserious in your last letter, when you asked me whether you wrote toooften, and seemed to think that you might thus interfere with myoccupations
 My dear Sophie, your letters are no small portion of myspiritual food, and help to keep my soul alive, when otherwise itmight languish unto death, or else become hardened and earth-incrusted,as seems to be the case with almost all the souls with whom I am indaily intercourse
 They never interfere with my worldly business--neither the reading nor the answering them--(I am speaking of yourletters, not of those "earth-incrusted" souls)--for I keep them to bethe treasure of my still and secret hours, such hours as pious peoplespend in prayer; and the communion which my spirit then holds withyours has something of religion in it
 The charm of your letters doesnot depend upon their intellectual value, though that is great, but onthe spirit of which they are the utterance, and which is a spirit ofwonderful efficacy
 No one, whom you would deem worthy of yourfriendship, could enjoy so large a share of it as I do, withoutfeeling the influence of your character throughout his own--purifyinghis aims and desires, enabling him to realise that this is a truerworld than the feverish one around us, and teaching him how to gaindaily entrance into that better world
 Such, so far as I have beenable to profit by it, has been your ministration to me
 Did you dreamwhat an angelic guardianship was entrusted to you?March 7th
 Your letter did come
 You had not the heart to disappointme, as I did you, in not making a parting visit, and shall again, bykeeping this letter to send by Mary
 But I disappoint you in these twoinstances, only that you may consider it a decree of Fate (or ofProvidence, which you please) that we shall not meet on the morningsof my departure, and that my letters shall not come oftener than onthe alternate Saturday
 If you will but believe this, you will bequiet
 Otherwise I know that the Dove will flutter her wings, andoften, by necessity, will flutter them in vain
 So forgive me, and letme have my own way, and believe (for it is true) that I never causeyou the slightest disappointment without pain and remorse on my part
And yet, I know that when you wish me to do any particular thing youwill always tell me so, and that if my sins of omission or commissionshould ever wound your heart, you will by no means conceal it
I did enjoy that walk infinitely--for certainly the enjoyment was notall finite
 And what a heavenly pleasure we might have enjoyed thisvery day; the air was so delicious, that it seemed as if the dismalold Custom House was situated in Paradise; and this afternoon, I satwith my window open, to temper the glow of a huge coal fire
 Italmost seems to me, now, as if beautiful days were wasted and thrownaway, when we do not feel their beauty and heavenliness through oneanother

 Peabody,     Salem, Mass
     , April 2d, 1839     Mine own Dove,I have been sitting by my fireside ever since teatime, till now it ispast eight o'clock; and have been musing and dreaming about a thousandthings, with every one of which, I do believe, some nearer or remoterthought of you was intermingled
 I should have begun this letterearlier in the evening, but was afraid that some intrusive idler wouldthrust himself between us, and so the sacredness of my letter would bepartly lost;--for I feel as if my letters were sacred, because theyare written from my spirit to your spirit
 I wish it were possible toconvey them to you by other than earthly messengers--to convey themdirectly into your heart, with the warmth of mine still lingering inthem
 When we shall be endowed with our spiritual bodies, I think theywill be so constituted, that we may send thoughts and feelings anydistance, in no time at all, and transfuse them warm and fresh intothe consciousness of those whom we love
 Oh what a bliss it would be,at this moment; if I could be conscious of some purer feeling, somemore delicate sentiment, some lovelier fantasy, than could possiblyhave had its birth in my own nature, and therefore be aware that myDove was thinking through my mind and feeling through my heart!Try--some evening when you are alone and happy, and when you are mostconscious of loving me and being loved by me--and see if you do notpossess this power already
 But, after all, perhaps it is not wise tointermix fantastic ideas with the reality of our affection
 Let uscontent ourselves to be earthly creatures, and hold communion ofspirit in such modes as are ordained to us--by letters (dipping ourpens as deep as may be into our hearts) by heartfelt words, when theycan be audible; by glances--through which medium spirits do reallyseem to talk in their own language--and by holy kisses, which I dothink have something supernatural in them
And now good night, my beautiful Dove
 I do not write any more atpresent, because there are three more whole days before this letterwill visit you: and I desire to talk with you, each of those threedays
 Your letter did not come today
 Even if it should not cometomorrow, I shall not imagine that you forget me or neglect me, butshall heave two or three sighs, and measure salt and coal so much themore diligently
 Good night; and if I have any power, at thisdistance, over your spirit, it shall be exerted to make you sleep likea little baby, till the "Harper of the Golden Dawn" arouse you
 Thenyou must finish that ode
 But do, if you love me, sleep
April 3d
 No letter, my dearest; and if one comes tomorrow I shall notreceive it till Friday, nor perhaps then; because I have a cargo ofcoal to measure in East Cambridge, and cannot go to the Custom Housetill the job is finished
 If you had known this, I think you wouldhave done your [best] possible to send me a letter today
 Doubtlessyou have some good reason for omitting it
 I was invited to dine atMr
 Hooper's; with your sister Mary; and the notion came into my head,that perhaps you would be there,--and though I knew that it could notbe so, yet I felt as if it might
 But just as I was going home fromthe Custom House to dress, came an abominable person to say that ameasurer was wanted forthwith at East Cambridge; so over I hurried,and found that, after all, nothing would be done till tomorrow morningat sunrise
 In the meantime, I had lost my dinner, and all otherpleasures that had awaited me at Mr
 Hooper's; so that I came back invery ill humor, and do not mean to be very good-natured again, till myDove shall nestle upon my heart again, either in her own sweet person,or by her image in a letter
 But your image will be with me, longbefore the letter comes
 It will flit around me while I am measuringcoal, and will peep over my shoulder to see whether I keep a correctaccount, and will smile to hear my bickerings with the black-faceddemons in the vessel's hold, (they look like the forge-men in Retsch'sFridolin) and will soothe and mollify me amid all the pester andplague that is in store for me tomorrow
 Not that I would avoid thispester and plague, even if it were in my power to do so
 I need suchtraining, and ought to have undergone it long ago
 It will give mycharacter a healthy hardness as regards the world; while it will leavemy heart as soft--as fit for a Dove to rest upon--as it is now, orever was
 Good night again, gentle Dove
 I must leave a little spacefor tomorrow's record; and moreover, it is almost time that I wereasleep, having to get up in the dusky dawn
 Did you yield to myconjurations, and sleep well last night? Well then, I throw the samespell over you tonight

 I came home late in the afternoon, verytired, sunburnt and sea-flushed, having walked or sat on the deck of aschooner ever since sunrise
 Nevertheless, I purified myself from thesable stains of my profession--stains which I share in common withchimney sweepers--and then hastened to the Custom House to get yourletter--for I knew there was one there awaiting me, and now I thankyou with my whole heart, and will straight way go to sleep
 Do you thesame
April 5th
 Your yesterday's letter is received, my beloved Sophie
 Ihave no time to answer it: but, like all your communications, personalor written, it is the sunshine of my life
 I have been busy all day,and am now going to see your sister Mary--and I hope, Elizabeth
 Mr
Pickens is going with me

     My Dearest:If it were not for your sake, I should really be glad of this pitilesseast wind, and should especially bless the pelting rain andintermingled snowflakes
 They have released me from the toils andcares of office, and given me license to betake myself to my ownchamber; and here I sit by a good coal fire, with at least six orseven comfortable hours to spend before bed-time
 I feel pretty secureagainst intruders; for the bad weather will defend me from foreigninvasion; and as to Cousin Haley, he and I had a bitter politicaldispute last evening, at the close of which he went to bed in highdudgeon, and probably will not speak to me these three days
 Thus youperceive that strife and wrangling, as well as east winds and rain,are the methods of a kind Providence to promote my comfort--whichwould not have been so well secured in any other way
 Six or sevenhours of cheerful solitude! But I will not be alone
 I invite yourspirit to be with me--at any hour and as many hours as you please--butespecially at the twilight hour, before I light my lamp
 Are youconscious of my invitation? I bid you at that particular time, becauseI can see visions more vividly in the dusky glow of fire light, thaneither by daylight or lamplight
 Come--and let me renew my spellagainst headache and other direful effects of the east wind
 How Iwish I could give you a portion of my insensibility!--And yet I shouldbe almost afraid of some radical transformation, were I to produce achange in that respect
 God made you so delicately, that it isespecially unsafe to interfere with His workmanship
 If my littleSophie--mine own Dove--cannot grow plump and rosy and tough andvigorous without being changed into another nature then I do thinkthat for this short life, she had better remain just what she is
 Yes;but you will always be the same to me, because we have met inEternity, and there our intimacy was formed
 So get as well as youpossibly can, and be as strong and rosy as you will; for I shall neverdoubt that you are the same Sophie who have so often leaned upon myarm, and needed its superfluous strength
I was conscious, on those two evenings, of a peacefulness andcontented repose such as I never enjoyed before
 You could not havefelt such quiet unless I had felt it too--nor could I, unless you had
If either of our spirits had been troubled, they were then in suchclose communion that both must have felt the same grief and turmoil
 Inever, till now, had a friend who could give me repose;--all havedisturbed me; and whether for pleasure or pain, it was stilldisturbance, but peace overflows from your heart into mine
 Then Ifeel that there is a Now--and that Now must be always calm andhappy--and that sorrow and evil are but phantoms that seem to flitacross it
You must never expect to see my sister E
 in the daytime, unless byprevious appointment, or when she goes to walk
 So unaccustomed am Ito daylight interviews, that I never imagine her in sunshine; and Ireally doubt whether her faculties of life and intellect begin to beexercised till dusk--unless on extraordinary occasions
 Their noon isat midnight
 I wish you could walk with her; but you must not, becauseshe is indefatigable, and always wants to walk half round the world,when once she is out of doors
April 18th
 My Dove--my hopes of a long evening of seclusion were notquite fulfilled; for, a little before nine o'clock John Forresterand Cousin Haley came in, both of whom I so fascinated with mydelectable conversation, that they did not take leave till aftereleven
 Nevertheless, I had already secured no inconsiderable treasureof enjoyment, with all of which you were intermingled
 There has beennothing to do at the Custom House today; so I came home at twoo'clock, and--went to sleep! Pray Heaven you may have felt asympathetic drowsiness, and have yielded to it
 My nap has been apretty long one, for--as nearly as I can judge by the position of thesun, it must be as much as five o'clock
 I think there will be abeautiful sunset; and perhaps, if we could walk out together, the windwould change and the air grow balmy at once
 The Spring is notacquainted with my Dove and me, as the Winter was;--how then can weexpect her to be kindly to us? We really must continue to walk out andmeet her, and make friends with her; then she will salute your cheekwith her balmiest kiss, whenever she gets a chance
 As to the eastwind, if ever the imaginative portion of my brain recover from itstorpor, I mean to personify it as a wicked, spiteful, blustering,treacherous--in short, altogether devilish sort of body, whoseprinciple of life it is to make as much mischief as he can
 The westwind--or whatever is the gentlest wind of heaven--shall assume youraspect, and be humanised and angelicised with your traits ofcharacter, and the sweet West shall finally triumph over the fiendlikeEast, and rescue the world from his miserable tyranny; and if I tellthe story well, I am sure my loving and beloved West Wind will kiss mefor it
When this week's first letter came, I held it a long time in my hand,marvelling at the superscription
 How did you contrive to write it?Several times since, I have pored over it, to discover how much ofyourself was mingled with my share of it; and certainly there is agrace flung over the fac simile, which was never seen in my harsh,uncouth autograph--and yet none of the strength is lost
 You arewonderful
 Imitate this

 Your Wednesday's letter has come, dearest
 Yourletters delight me more than anything, save the sound of your voice;and I love dearly to write to you--so be at peace on that score
 Youare beautiful, my own heart's Dove
 Never doubt it again
 I shallreally and truly be very glad of the extracts; and they will have acharm for me that could not otherwise have been
 I will imagine yourvoice repeating them, tremulously
 The spell which you laid upon mybrow will retain its power till we meet again--then it must berenewed
What a beautiful day--and I had a double enjoyment of it, for yoursake and my own
 I have been to walk this afternoon, to Bunker's Hilland the Navy Yard, and am tired, because I had not your arm to supportme
God keep you from East winds and every other evil

, 1839     My beloved,Your sweetest of all letters found me at the Custom House, where I hadalmost just arrived, having been engaged all the forenoon in measuringtwenty chaldrons of coal--which dull occupation was enlivened byfrequent brawls and amicable discussions with a crew of funny littleFrenchmen from Acadie
 I know not whether your letter was a surpriseto me--it seems to me that I had a prophetic faith that the Dove wouldvisit me--but at any rate, it was a joy, as it always is; for myspirit turns to you from all trouble and all pleasure
 This forenoon Icould not wait as I generally do, to be in solitude before openingyour letter; for I expected to be busy all the afternoon, and wasalready tired with working yesterday and today; and my heart longed todrink your thoughts and feelings, as a parched throat for cold water
So I pressed the Dove to my lips (turning my head away, so thatnobody saw me) and then broke the seal
 I do think it is the dearestletter you have written, but I think so of each successive one; so youneed not imagine that you have outdone yourself in this instance
 Howdid I live before I knew you--before I possessed your affection! Ireckon upon your love as something that is to endure when everythingthat can perish has perished--though my trust is sometimes mingledwith fear, because I feel myself unworthy of your love
 But if I amworthy of if you will always love me; and if there be anything goodand pure in me, it will be proved by my always loving you
After dinner
 I had to journey over to East Cambridge, expecting tomeasure a cargo of coal there; but the vessel had stuck in the mud onher way thither, so that nothing could be done till tomorrow morning
It must have been my guardian angel that steered her upon thatmud-bank, for I really needed rest
 Did you lead the vessel astray, myDove? I did not stop to inquire into particulars, but returned homeforthwith, and locked my door, and threw myself on the bed, with yourletter in my hand
 I read it over slowly and peacefully, and thenfolding it up, I rested my heart upon it, and fell fast asleep
Friday, May 3d

 My dearest, ten million occupations andinterruptions, and intrusions, have kept me from going on with myletter; but my spirit has visited you continually, and yours has cometo me
 I have had to be out a good deal in the east winds; but yourspell has proved sovereign against all harm, though sometimes I haveshuddered and shivered for your sake
 How have you borne it, my poordear little Dove? Have you been able to flit abroad on today's eastwind, and go to Marblehead, as you designed? You will not have seenMrs
 Hooper, because she came up to  in the cars on Mondaymorning
 I had a brief talk with her, and we made mutual inquiries,she about you, and I about little C
 I will not attempt to tell youhow it rejoices me that we are to spend a whole month together in thesame city
 Looking forward to it, it seems to me as if that monthwould never come to an end, because there will be so much of eternityin it
 I wish you had read that dream-letter through, and couldremember its contents
 I am very sure that it could not have [been]written by me, however, because I should not think of addressing youas "My dear Sister"--nor should I like to have you call mebrother--nor even should have liked it, from the very first of ouracquaintance
 We are, I trust, kindred spirits, but not brother andsister
 And then what a cold and dry annunciation of that awfulcontingency--the "continuance or not of our acquaintance
" Mine ownDove, you are to blame for dreaming such letters, or parts of letters,as coming from me
 It was you that wrote it--not I
 Yet I will notbelieve that it shows a want of faith in the steadfastness of myaffection, but only in the continuance of circumstances prosperous toour earthly and external connection
 Let us trust in GOD for that
Pray to GOD for it, my Dove--for you know how to pray better than Ido
 Pray, for my sake, that no shadows of earth may ever come betweenus, because my only hope of being a happy man depends upon thepermanence of our union
 I have great comfort in such thoughts asthose you suggest--that our hearts here draw towards one another sounusually--that we have not cultivated our friendship, but let itgrow,--that we have thrown ourselves upon one another with suchperfect trust;--and even the deficiency of worldly wisdom, that somepeople would ascribe to us in following the guidance of our hearts soimplicitly, is proof to me that there is a deep wisdom within us
 Oh,let us not think but that all will be well! And even if, to worldlyeyes, it should appear that our lot is not a fortunate one, still weshall have glimpses, at least--and I trust a pervading sunshine--of ahappiness that we could never have found, if we had unquietlystruggled for it, and made our own selection of the means and speciesof it, instead of trusting all to something diviner than our reason
My Dove, there were a good many things that I meant to have written inthis letter; but I have continually lapsed into fits of musing, andwhen I have written, the soul of my thoughts has not readily assumedthe earthly garments of language
 It is now time to carry the letterto Mary
 I kiss you, dearest--did you feel it? Your own friend,     NATH
 HAWTHORNE, ESQ
(Dear me! What an effect that Esquire gives to the whole letter!)          Salem, May 26th, 1839     Mine own Self,I felt rather dismal yesterday--a sort of vague weight on my spirit--asense that something was wanting to me here
 What or who could it havebeen that I so missed? I thought it not best to go to your house lastevening; so that I have not yet seen Elizabeth--but we shall probablyattend the Hurley-Burley tonight
 Would that my Dove might be there!It seems really monstrous that here, in her own home--or what was herhome, till she found another in my arms--she should no longer be
 Oh,my dearest, I yearn for you, and my heart heaves when I think ofyou--(and that is always, but sometimes a thought makes me know andfeel you more vividly than at others, and that I call "thinking ofyou")--heaves and swells (my heart does) as sometimes you have felt itbeneath you, when your head was resting on it
 At such moments it isstirred up from its depths
 Then our two ocean-hearts mingle theirfloods
I do not believe that this letter will extend to three pages
 Myfeelings do not, of their own accord, assume words--at least, not acontinued flow of words
 I write a few lines, and then I fall a-musingabout many things, which seem to have no connection among themselves,save that my Dove flits lightly through them all
 I feel as if mybeing were dissolved and the idea of you were diffused throughout it
Am I writing nonsense? That is for you to decide
 You know what isTruth--"what is what"--and I should not dare to say to you what I feltto be other than the Truth--other than the very "what
" It is verysingular (but I do not suppose I can express it) that, while I loveyou so dearly, and while I am so conscious of the deep embrace of ourspirits, still I have an awe of you that I never felt for anybodyelse
 Awe is not the word, either; because it might imply somethingstern in you--whereas--but you must make it out for yourself
 I dowish that I could put this into words--not so much for yoursatisfaction (because I believe you will understand) as for my own
 Isuppose I should have pretty much the same feeling if an angel were tocome from Heaven and be my dearest friend--only the angel could nothave the tenderest of human natures too, the sense of which ismingled with this sentiment
 Perhaps it is because in meeting you, Ireally meet a spirit, whereas the obstructions of earth have preventedsuch a meeting in every other place
 But I leave the mystery here
Some time or other, it may be made plainer to me
 But methinks itconverts my love into a religion
 And then it is singular, too, thatthis awe (or whatever it be) does not prevent me from feeling that itis I who have the charge of you, and that my Dove is to follow myguidance and do my bidding
 Am I not very bold to say this? And willnot you rebel? Oh no; because I possess the power only so far as Ilove you
 My love gives me the right, and your love consents to it
Since writing the above I have been asleep; and I dreamed that I hadbeen sleeping a whole year in the open air; and that while I slept,the grass grew around me
 It seemed, in my dream, that the verybed-clothes which actually covered me were spread beneath me, and whenI awoke (in my dream) I snatched them up, and the earth under themlooked black, as if it had been burnt--one square place, exactly thesize of the bedclothes
 Yet there was grass and herbage scattered overthis burnt space, looking as fresh, and bright, and dewy, as if thesummer rain and the summer sun had been cherishing them all thetime
 Interpret this for me, my Dove--but do not draw any somber omensfrom it
 What is signified [by] my nap of a whole year? (It made megrieve to think that I had lost so much of eternity)--and what was thefire that blasted the spot of earth which I occupied, while the grassflourished all around?--And what comfort am I to draw from the freshherbage amid the burnt space? But it is a silly dream, and you cannotexpound any sense out of it
 Generally, I cannot remember what mydreams have been--only there is a confused sense of having passedthrough adventures, pleasurable or otherwise
 I suspect that youmingle with my dreams, but take care to flit away just before I awake,leaving me but dimly and doubtfully conscious of your visits
Do you never start so suddenly from a dream that you are afraid tolook round the room, lest your dream-personages (so strong anddistinct seemed their existence, a moment before) should have thrustthemselves out of dream-land into the midst of realities? I do,sometimes
I wish I were to see you this evening
 How many times have you thoughtof me today? All the time?--Or not at all? Did you ever read such afoolish letter as this? (Here I was interrupted, and have taken astroll down on the Neck--a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful sunshine,and air, and sea
 Would that my Dove had been with me
 I fear that weshall perforce lose some of our mutual intimacy with Nature--we walktogether so seldom that she will seem more like a stranger
 Would thatI could write such sweet letters to mine own self, as mine own selfwrites to me
 Good bye, dearest self

 4 Avon Place,     
     , July 3d, 1839     Most beloved Amelia,I shall call you so sometimes in playfulness, and so may you; but itis not the name by which my soul recognizes you
 It knows you asSophie; but I doubt whether that is the inwardly and intensely dearestepithet either
 I believe that "Dove" is the true word after all; andit never can be used amiss, whether in sunniest gaiety or shadiestseriousness
 And yet it is a sacred word, and I should not love tohave anybody hear me use it, nor know that GOD has baptised youso--the baptism being for yourself and me alone
 By that name, Ithink, I shall greet you when we meet in Heaven
 Other dear ones maycall you "daughter," "sister," "Sophia," but when, at your entranceinto Heaven, or after you have been a little while there, you hear avoice say "Dove!" then you will know that your kindred spirit has beenadmitted (perhaps for your sake) to the mansions of rest
 That wordwill express his yearning for you--then to be forever satisfied; forwe will melt into one another, and be close, close together then
 Thename was inspired; it came without our being aware that you werethenceforth to be my Dove, now and through eternity
 I do notremember, how nor when it alighted on you; the first I knew, it was inmy heart to call you so
Good night now, my Dove
 It is not yet nine o'clock; but I am somewhataweary and prefer to muse about you till bedtime, rather than write
July 5th, ½ past seven P
M
 I must, somehow or other, finish thisletter tonight, my dearest--or else it would not be sent tomorrow; andthen I fear our head would ache, naughty head that it is
 My heartyearns to communicate to you; but if it had any other means at hand,it certainly would not choose to communicate by the scratchings of aniron pen, which I am now compelled to use
 This must and willinevitably be a dull letter
 Oh how different from yours, which Ireceived today
 You are absolutely inspired, my Dove; and it is not mypoor stupid self that inspires you; for how could I give what is notin me
 I wish I could write to you in the morning, before my toilsbegin; but that is impossible, unless I were to write before daylight
At eventide, my mind has quite lost its elasticity--my heart, even,is weary--and all that I seem capable of doing is to rest my head onits pillow and there lay down the burthen of life
 I do not mean toimply that I am unhappy or discontented; for this is not the case; mylife is only a burthen, in the same way that it is so to everytoilsome man, and mine is a healthy weariness, such as needs only anight's sleep to remove it
 But from henceforth forever, I shall beentitled to call the sons of toil my brethren, and shall know how tosympathise with them, seeing that I, likewise, have risen at the dawnand borne the fervor of the mid-day sun, nor turned my heavy footstepshomeward till eventide
 Years hence, perhaps, the experience that myheart is acquiring now will flow out in truth and wisdom
You ask me a good many questions, my Dove, and I will answer such ofthem as now occur to me; and the rest you may ask me again, when wemeet
 First as to your letters
 My beloved, you must write wheneveryou will--in all confidence that I can never be otherwise than joyfulto receive your letters
 Do not get into the habit of trying to findout, by any method save your own intuition, what is pleasing and whatis displeasing to me
 Whenever you need my counsel, or even myreproof, in any serious matter, you will not fail to receive it; but Iwish my Dove to be as free as a Bird of Paradise
 Now, as to thisaffair of the letters
 I have sometimes been a little annoyed at thesmiles of my brother measurers, who, notwithstanding the masculinefist of the direction, seem to know that such delicately sealed andfolded epistles can come only from a lady's small and tender hand
 Butthe annoyance is not on my own account; but because it seems as if theletters were prophaned by being smiled at--but this is, after all, amere fantasy, since the smilers know nothing about my Dove, nor that Ireally have a Dove; nor can they be certain that the letters come froma lady, nor, especially, can they have the remotest imagination whatheavenly letters they are
 The sum and substance is, that they aresmiling at nothing; and so it is no matter for their smiles
 I wouldnot give up one letter to avoid the "world's dread laugh,"--much lessto shun the good-natured raillery of three or four people who do notdream of giving pain
 Why has my Dove made me waste so much of myletter in this talk about nothing?My dearest, did you really think that I meant to express a doubtwhether we should enjoy each other's society so much, if we could betogether all the time
 No, no; for I always feel, that our momentaryand hurried interviews scarcely afford us time to taste the draught ofaffection that we drink from one another's hearts
 There is a preciousportion of our happiness wasted, because we are forced to enjoy it toogreedily
 But I thought, as you do, that there might be morecommunication of the intellect, as well as communion of heart, if wecould be oftener together
Your picture gallery of auxiliary verbs is an admirable fantasy
 Youare certainly the first mortal to whom it was given to behold a verb;though, it seems as if they ought to be visible, being creatures whoseoffice it is (if I remember my grammar aright) "to be, to do, and tosuffer
" Therein is comprehended all that we mortals are capable of
No; for, according to the definition, verbs do not feel, and cannotenjoy--they only exist, and act, and are miserable
 My Dove and I areno verbs--or if so, we are passive verbs, and therefore happy ones

 I put it in my pocket, and didnot read it till just now, when I could be quiet in my ownchamber--for I always feel as if your letters were too sacred to beread in the midst of people--and (you will smile) I never read themwithout first washing my hands!And so my poor Dove is sick, and I cannot take her to my bosom
 I doreally feel as if I could cure her
 [Portion of letter missing] Oh, mydearest, do let our love be powerful enough to make you well
 I willhave faith in its efficacy--not that it will work an immediatemiracle--but it shall make you so well at heart that you cannotpossibly be ill in the body
 Partake of my health and strength, mybeloved
 Are they not your own, as well as mine? Yes--and your illnessis mine as well as yours; and with all the pain it gives me, the wholeworld should not buy my right to share in it
My dearest, I will not be much troubled, since you tell me (and yourword is always truth) that there is no need
 But, oh, be careful ofyourself--remembering how much earthly happiness depends on yourhealth
 Be tranquil--let me be your Peace, as you are mine
 Do notwrite to me, unless your heart be unquiet, and you think that you canquiet it by writing
God bless mine own Dove
 I have kissed those three last words
 Do youkiss them too
          Wednesday eveg
 July 17th [1839]     My Dearest,I did not know but you would like another little note--and I think Ifeel a strange impulse to write, now that the whole correspondencedevolves on me
 And I wrote my other note in such a hurry, that Iquite forgot to give you the praise which you so deserved, for bearingup so stoutly against the terrible misfortune of my non-appearance
Indeed, I do think my Dove is the strongest little dove that ever wascreated--never did any creature live, who could feel so acutely, andyet endure so well
This note must be a mere word, my beloved--and I wish I could make itthe very tenderest word that ever was spoken or written
 Imagine allthat I cannot write
God bless you, mine own Dove, and make you quite well against I takeyou to your home--which shall be on Saturday eveg, without fail
 Tillthen, dearest, spend your time in happy thoughts and happydreams--and let my image be among them
 Good bye, mine own Dove--Ihave kissed that holy word
     YOUR OWN, OWN, OWNEST
My Dove must not look for another note
          , July 24th, 1839--8 o'clock P

     Mine own,I am tired this evening, as usual, with my long day's toil; and myhead wants its pillow--and my soul yearns for the friend whom God hasgiven it--whose soul He has married to my soul
 Oh, my dearest, howthat thought thrills me! We are married! I felt it long ago; andsometimes, when I was seeking for some fondest word, it has been on mylips to call you--"Wife"! I hardly know what restrained me fromspeaking it--unless a dread (for that would have been an infinitepang to me) of feeling you shrink back, and thereby discovering thatthere was yet a deep place in your soul which did not know me
 Mineown Dove, need I fear it now? Are we not married? God knows we are
Often, I have silently given myself to you, and received you for myportion of human love and happiness, and have prayed Him to consecrateand bless the union
 Yes--we are married; and as God Himself hasjoined us, we may trust never to be separated, neither in Heaven noron Earth
 We will wait patiently and quietly, and He will lead usonward hand in hand (as He has done all along) like little children,and will guide us to our perfect happiness--and will teach us when ourunion is to be revealed to the world
 My beloved, why should we besilent to one another--why should our lips be silent--any longer onthis subject? The world might, as yet, misjudge us; and therefore wewill not speak to the world; but why should we not commune togetherabout all our hopes of earthly and external as well [as] our faith ofinward and eternal union? Farewell for tonight, my dearest--my soul'sbride!July 25th

 How does my Dove contrive to live andthrive, and keep her heart in cheerful trim, through a wholefortnight, with only one letter from me? It cannot be indifference; soit must be heroism--and how heroic! It does seem to me that my spiritwould droop and wither like a plant that lacked rain and dew, if itwere not for the frequent shower of your gentle and holy thoughts
 Butthen there is such a difference in our situations
 My Dove is athome--not, indeed, in her home of homes--but still in the midst oftrue affections; and she can live a spiritual life, spiritual andintellectual
 Now, my intellect, and my heart and soul, have no sharein my present mode of life--they find neither labor nor food in it;everything that I do here might be better done by a machine
 I am amachine, and am surrounded by hundreds of similar machines;--orrather, all of the business people are so many wheels of one greatmachine--and we have no more love or sympathy for one another than ifwe were made of wood, brass, or iron, like the wheels of other piecesof complicated machinery
 Perchance--but do not be frightened,dearest--the soul would wither and die within me, leaving nothing butthe busy machine, no germ for immortality, nothing that could taste ofheaven, if it were not for the consciousness of your deep, deep love,which is renewed to me with every letter
 Oh, my Dove, I have reallythought sometimes, that God gave you to me to be the salvation of mysoul
     (Rest of letter missing)     , July 30th, 8 (or thereabouts) P

 [1839]     Beloved,There was no letter from you to-day; and this circumstance, inconnection with your mention of a headache on Sunday, made meapprehensive that my Dove is not well
 Yet surely she would write, orcause to be written, intelligence of the fact (if fact it were) to thesharer of her well-being and ill-being
 Do, dearest, give me theassurance that you will never be ill without letting me know, and thenI shall always be at peace, and will not disquiet myself for thenon-reception of a letter; for really, I would not have you crowd yourother duties into too small a space, nor dispense with anything thatit is desirable to do, for the sake of writing to me
 If you were notto write for a whole year, I still should never doubt that you love meinfinitely; and I doubt not that, in vision, dream, or reverie, ourwedded souls would hold communion throughout all that time
Therefore I do not ask for letters while you are well, but leave allto your own heart and judgment; but if anything, bodily or mental,afflicts my Dove, her beloved must be told
And why was my dearest wounded by that silly sentence of mine about"indifference"? It was not well that she should do anything but smileat it
 I knew, just as certainly as your own heart knows, that myletters are very precious to you--had I been less certain of it, Inever could have trifled upon the subject
 Oh, my darling, let allyour sensibilities be healthy--never, never, be wounded by what oughtnot to wound
 Our tenderness should make us mutually susceptible ofhappiness from every act of each other, but of pain from none; ourmighty love should scorn all little annoyances, even from the objectof that love
 What misery (and what ridiculous misery too) would itbe, if, because we love one another better than all the universebesides, our only gain thereby were a more exquisite sensibility topain for the beloved hand and a more terrible power of inflicting it!Dearest, it never shall be so with us
 We will have such an infinityof mutual faith, that even real offenses (should they ever occur)shall not wound, because we know that something external from yourselfor myself must be guilty of the wrong, and never our essentialselves
 My beloved wife, there is no need of all this preachment now;but let us both meditate upon it, and talk to each other about it;--soshall there never come any cloud across our inward bliss--so shall oneof our hearts never wound the other, and itself fester with the sorethat it inflicts
 And I speak now, when my Dove is not wounded norsore, because it is easier than it might be hereafter, when somecareless and wayward act or word of mine may have rubbed too roughlyagainst her tenderest of hearts
 Dearest, I beseech you grant mefreedom to be careless and wayward--for I have had such freedom all mylife
 Oh, let me feel that I may even do you a little wrong withoutyour avenging it (oh how cruelly) by being wounded
     (Rest of letter missing)     Custom House, August 8th, 1839Your letter, my beloved wife, was duly received into your husband'sheart yesterday
 I found it impossible to keep it all day long, withunbroken seal, in my pocket; and so I opened and read it on board of asalt vessel, where I was at work, amid all sorts of bustle, and gabbleof Irishmen, and other incommodities
 Nevertheless its effect was veryblessed, even as if I had gazed upward from the deck of the vessel,and beheld my wife's sweet face looking down upon me from asun-brightened cloud
 Dearest, if your dove-wings will not carry youso far, I beseech you to alight upon such a cloud sometimes, and letit bear you to me
 True it is, that I never look heavenward withoutthinking of you, and I doubt whether it would much surprise me tocatch a glimpse of you among those upper regions
 Then would all thatis spiritual within me so yearn towards you, that I should leave myearthly incumbrances behind, and float upward and embrace you in theheavenly sunshine
 Yet methinks I shall be more content to spend alifetime of earthly and heavenly happiness intermixed
 So human am I,my beloved, that I would not give up the hope of loving and cherishingyou by a fireside of our own, not for any unimaginable bliss of higherspheres
 Your influence shall purify me and fit me for a betterworld--but it shall be by means of our happiness here below
Was such a rhapsody as the foregoing ever written in the Custom Housebefore? I have almost felt it a sin to write to my Dove here, becauseher image comes before me so vividly--and the place is not worthy ofit
 Nevertheless, I cast aside my scruples, because, having been awakeever since four o'clock this morning (now thirteen hours) and abroadsince sunrise, I shall feel more like holding intercourse in dreamsthan with my pen, when secluded in my room
 I am not quite hopeless,now, of meeting you in dreams
 Did you not know, beloved, that Idreamed of you, as it seemed to me, all night long, after that lastblissful meeting? It is true, when I looked back upon the dream, itimmediately became confused; but it had been vivid, and most happy,and left a sense of happiness in my heart
 Come again, sweet wife!Force your way through the mists and vapors that envelope myslumbers--illumine me with a radiance that shall not vanish when Iawake
 I throw my heart as wide open to you as I can
 Come and restwithin it, Dove
Oh, how happy you make me by calling me your husband--by subscribingyourself my wife
 I kiss that word when I meet it in your letters; andI repeat over and over to myself, "she is my wife--I am her husband
"Dearest, I could almost think that the institution of marriage wasordained, first of all, for you and me, and for you and me alone; itseems so fresh and new--so unlike anything that the people around usenjoy or are acquainted with
 Nobody ever had a wife but me--nobody ahusband, save my Dove
 Would that the husband were worthier of hiswife; but she loves him--and her wise and prophetic heart could neverdo so if he were utterly unworthy
My own Room
 August 9th--about 10 A

 It is so rare a thing foryour husband to find himself in his own room in the middle of theforenoon, that he cannot help advising his Dove of that remarkablefact
 By some misunderstanding, I was sent on a fruitless errand toEast Cambridge, and have stopped here, on my return to the CustomHouse, to rest and refresh myself--and what can so rest and refresh meas to hold intercourse with my darling wife? It must be but a word anda kiss, however--a written word and a shadowy kiss
 Good bye, dearest
I must go now to hold controversy, I suppose, with some plaguy littleFrenchman about a peck of coal more or less; but I will give mybeloved another word and kiss, when the day's toil is over

--I received your letter, your sweet, sweetletter, my sweetest wife, on reaching the Custom House
 Now as to thatswelled face of ours--it had begun to swell when we last met; but Idid not tell you, because I knew that you would associate the idea ofpain with it, whereas, it was attended with no pain at all
 Very gladam I, that my Dove did not see me when one side of my face was swollenas big as two, for the image of such a monstrous one-sidedness, ordouble-sidedness, might have haunted her memory through the wholefortnight
 Dearest, is it a weakness that your husband wishes to looktolerably comely always in your eyes?--and beautiful if he could!! MyDove is beautiful, and full of grace; she should not have an uglymate
 But to return to this "naughty swelling"--it began to subsideon Tuesday, and has now, I think, entirely disappeared, leaving myvisage in its former admirable proportion
 Nothing is now the matterwith me; save that my heart is as much swollen as my cheekwas--swollen with love, with pent-up love, which I would fain minglewith the heart-blood of mine own sweet wife
 Oh, dearest, how much Ihave to say to you!--how many fond thoughts
Dearest, I dare not give you permission to go out in the east winds
The west wind will come very often I am sure, if it were only for thesake of my Dove
 Have nothing to do with that hateful east wind
          , August 21st, 1839My dearest will be glad to know that her husband has not had to endurethe heavy sunshine this afternoon;--he came home at three o'clock orthereabout, and locking the door, betook himself to sleep--firstensuring himself sweet slumber and blissful dreams (if any dreamsshould come) by reperusing his sweet wife's letter
 His wife was withhim at the moment of falling asleep, and at the moment of awaking; butshe stole away from him during the interval
 Naughty wife!Nevertheless, he has slept and is refreshed--slept how long he doesnot know; but the sun has made a far progress downward, since heclosed his eyes
Oh, my wife, if it were possible that you should vanish from me, Ifeel and know that my soul would be solitary forever and ever
 Ialmost think that there would be no "forever" for me
 I could notencounter such a desolate Eternity, were you to leave me
 You are myfirst hope and my last
 If you fail me (but there is no such if) Imight toil onward through this life without much outward change, but Ishould sink down and die utterly upon the threshold of the drearyFuture
 Were you to find yourself deceived, you would betakeyourself at once to God and Heaven, in the certainty of there findinga thousand-fold recompense for all earthly disappointment; but withme, it seems as if hope and happiness would be torn up by the roots,and could never bloom again, neither in this soil nor the soil ofParadise

 I was interrupted by the supperbell, while writing the foregoing sentence; and much that I might haveadded has now passed out of my mind--or passed into its depths
 Mybeloved wife, let us make no question about our love, whether it betrue
 Were it otherwise, God would not have left your heart to wreckitself utterly--His angels keep watch over you--they would have givenyou early and continued warning of the approach of Evil in any shape
Two letters has my Dove blessed me with, since that of Monday--bothbeautiful--all three, indeed, most beautiful
 There is a great deal inall of them that should be especially answered; but how may this beeffected in one little sheet?--moreover, it is my pleasure to writein a more desultory fashion
Nevertheless, propound as many questions as you see fit, in yourletters, but, dearest, let it be without expectation of a setresponse
When I first looked at that shadow of the Passing Hour, I thought herexpression too sad; but the more I looked the sweeter and pleasanterit grew--and now I am inclined to think that few mortals are waited onby happier Hours than is my Dove, even in her pensive moods
 Mybeloved, you make a Heaven round about you, and dwell in itcontinually; and as it is your Heaven, so is it mine
 My heart has notbeen very heavy--not desperately heavy--any one time since I lovedyou; not even your illness and headaches, dearest wife, can make medesperately sad
 My stock of sunshine is so infinitely increased bypartaking of yours, that even when a cloud flits by, I incomparablyprefer its gloom to the sullen, leaden tinge that used to overspreadmy sky
 Were you to bring me, in outward appearance, nothing save aload of grief and pain, yet I do believe that happiness, in no stintedmeasure, would somehow or other be smuggled into the dismal burthen
But you come to me with no grief--no pain--you come with flowers ofParadise; some in bloom, many in the bud, and all of them immortal
August 23d--between 7 and 8 P

 Dearest wife, when I think how soonthis letter will greet you, it makes my heart yearn towards you somuch the more
 How much of life we waste! Oh, beloved, if we had but acottage somewhere beyond the sway of the east wind, yet within thelimits of New England, where we could be always together, and have aplace to be in--what could we desire more? Nothing--save dailybread, (or rather bread and milk, for I think I should adopt yourdiet) and clean white apparel every day for mine unspotted Dove
 Thenhow happy I would be--and how good! I could not be other than good andhappy, when your kiss would sanctify me at all my outgoings andincomings
 And you should draw, and paint, and sculpture, and makemusic, and poetry too, and your husband would admire and criticise;and I, being pervaded with your spirit, would write beautifully andmake myself famous for your sake, because perhaps you would like tohave the world acknowledge me--but if the whole world glorified mewith one voice, it would be a meed of little value in comparison withmy wife's smile and kiss
 For I shall always read my manuscripts toyou, in the summer afternoons or winter evenings; and if they pleaseyou I shall expect a smile and a kiss as my reward--and if they do notplease, I must have a smile and kiss to comfort me
Good bye--sweet, sweet, dear, dear, sweetest, dearest wife
 I receivedthe kiss you sent me and have treasured it up in my heart
 Take onefrom your own husband

 Peabody,     Salem, Mass
     , August 25th, 1839     Dearest Wife,I did not write you yesterday, for several reasons--partly becauseI was interrupted by company; and also I had a difficult letterto project and execute in behalf of an office-seeker; and inthe afternoon I fell asleep amid thoughts of my own Dove; andwhen I awoke, I took up Miss Martineau's Deerbrook, and becameinterested in it--because, being myself a lover, nothing that treatsearnestly of love can be indifferent to me
 Some truth in the bookI recognised--but there seems to be too much of dismal fantasy
Thus, one way or another, the Sabbath passed away without my pouringout my heart to my sweet wife on paper; but I thought of you, dearest,all day long
 Your letter came this forenoon, and I opened it on boardof a salt-ship, and snatched portions of it in the intervals ofkeeping tally
 Every letter of yours is as fresh and new as if you hadnever written a preceding one--each is like a strain of music unheardbefore, yet all are in sweet accordance--all of them introduce medeeper and deeper into your being, yet there is no sense of surpriseat what I see, and feel, and know, therein
 I am familiar with yourinner heart, as with my home; but yet there is a sense ofrevelation--or perhaps of recovered intimacy with a dearest friendlong hidden from me
 Were you not my wife in some past eternity?Dearest, perhaps these speculations are not wise
 We will not castdreamy glances too far behind us or before us, but live our presentlife in simplicity; for methinks that is the way to realise it mostintensely
 Good night, most beloved
 Your husband is presently goingto bed; for the bell has just rung (those bells are alwaysinterrupting us, whether for dinner, or supper, or bed-time) and herose early this morning, and must be abroad at sunrise tomorrow
 Goodnight, my wife
 Receive your husband's kiss upon your eyelids

 ½ past 7 o'clock
 Very dearest, your husband has beenstationed all day at the end of Long Wharf, and I rather think that hehad the most eligible situation of anybody in 
 I was aware thatit must be intensely hot in the middle of the city; but there was onlya very short space of uncomfortable heat in my region, half-waytowards the center of the harbour; and almost all the time there was apure and delightful breeze, fluttering and palpitating, sometimesshyly kissing my brow, then dying away, and then rushing upon me inlivelier sport, so that I was fain to settle my straw hat tighter uponmy head
 Late in the afternoon, there was a sunny shower, which camedown so like a benediction, that it seemed ungrateful to take shelterin the cabin, or to put up an umbrella
 Then there was a rainbow, or alarge segment of one, so exceedingly brilliant, and of such longendurance, that I almost fancied it was stained into the sky, andwould continue there permanently
 And there were clouds floating allabout, great clouds and small, of all glorious and lovely hues (savethat imperial crimson, which was never revealed save to our unitedgaze) so glorious, indeed, and so lovely, that I had a fantasy ofHeaven's being broken into fleecy fragments, and dispersedthroughout space, with its blessed inhabitants yet dwelling blissfullyupon those scattered islands
 Oh, how I do wish that my sweet wife andI could dwell upon a cloud, and follow the sunset round about theearth! Perhaps she might; but my nature is too earthy to permit me todwell there with her--and I know well that she would not leave mehere
 Dearest, how I longed for you to be with me, both in the showerand the sunshine
 I did but half see what was to be seen, nor but halffeel the emotions which the scene ought to have produced
 Had you beenthere, I do think that we should have remembered this among our mostwondrously beautiful sunsets
 And the sea was very beautiful too
Would it not be a pleasant life to--but I will not sketch out any morefantasies tonight
Beloved, have not I been gone a great while? Truly it seems to me verylong; and it [is] strange what an increase of apparent length isalways added by two or three days of the second week
 Do not you yearnto see me? I know you do, dearest
 How do I know it? How should I,save by my own heart?Dearest wife, I am tired now, and have scribbled this letter in suchslovenly fashion that I fear you will hardly be able to readit--nevertheless, I have been happy in writing it
 But now, though itis so early yet, I shall throw aside my pen, especially as the paperis so nearly covered
My sweet Dove,     Good night

Belovedest little wife--sweetest Sophie Hawthorne--what a deliciouswalk that was, last Thursday! It seems to me, now, as it I couldreally remember every footstep of it
 It is almost as distinct as therecollection of those walks, in which my earthly form did really treadbeside your own, and my arm upheld you; and, indeed, it has the samecharacter as those heavenly ramblings;--for did we tread on earth everthen? Oh no--our souls went far away among the sunset clouds, andwherever there was ethereal beauty, there were we, our true selves;and it was there we grew into each other, and became a married pair
Dearest, I love to date our marriage as far back as possible, and Ifeel sure that the tie had been formed, and our union had becomeindissoluble, even before we sat down together on the steps of the"house of spirits
" How beautiful and blessed those hours appear tome! True; we are far more conscious of our relation, and thereforeinfinitely happier, now, than we were then; but still thoseremembrances are among the most precious treasures of my soul
 It isnot past happiness; it makes a portion of our present bliss
 And thus,doubtless, even amid the joys of Heaven, we shall love to look back toour earthly bliss, and treasure it forever in the sum of an infinitelyaccumulating happiness
 Perhaps not a single pressure of the hand, nota glance, not a sweet and tender tone, but will be repeated sometimeor other in our memory
Oh, dearest, blessedest Dove, I never felt sure of going to Heaven,till I knew that you loved me; but now I am conscious of God's love inyour own
 And now, good bye for a little while, mine own wife
 Ithought it was just on the verge of supper-time when I began towrite--and there is the bell now
 I was beginning to fear that it hadrung unheard while I was communing with my Dove
 Should we be the moreethereal, if we did not eat? I have a most human and earthlyappetite
Mine own wife, since supper I have been reading over again (for thethird time--the two first being aboard my saltship--the MarciaCleaves) your letter of yesterday--and a dearest letter it is--andmeeting with Sophie Hawthorne twice, I took the liberty to kiss hervery fervently
 Will she forgive me? Do know yourself by that name,dearest, and think of yourself as Sophie Hawthorne? It thrills myheart to write it, and still more, I think, to read it in the fairyletters of your own hand
 Oh, you are my wife, my dearest, truest,tenderest, most beloved wife
 I would not be disjoined from you for amoment, for all the world
 And how strong, while I write, is theconsciousness that I am truly your husband!My little Dove
 I have observed that butterflies--very broad-wingedand magnificent butterflies--frequently come on board of the salt shipwhen I am at work
 What have these bright strangers to do on LongWharf, where there are no flowers or any green thing--nothing butbrick stores, stone piles, black ships, and the bustle of toilsomemen, who neither look up to the blue sky, nor take note of thesewandering gems of air
 I cannot account for them, unless, dearest,they are the lovely fantasies of your mind, which you send thitherin search of me
 There is the supper-bell
 Good-bye, darling

Belovedest, your two precious letters have arrived--the firstyesterday forenoon, the second today
 In regard to the first, therewas a little circumstance that affected me so pleasantly, that Icannot help telling my sweetest wife of it
 I had read it over threetimes, I believe, and was reading it again, towards evening in myroom; when I discovered, in a remote region of the sheet, two or threelines which I had not before seen, and which Sophie Hawthorne hadsigned with her own name
 It is the strangest thing in the world thatI had not read them before--but certainly it was a happy accident;for, finding them so unexpectedly, when I supposed that I already hadthe whole letter by heart, it seemed as if there had been a suddenrevelation of my Dove--as if she had stolen into my room (as, in herlast epistle, she dreams of doing) and made me sensible of herpresence at that very moment
 Dearest, since writing the above, Ihave been interrupted by some official business; for I am at presentfilling the place of Colonel Hall as head of the measurers'department--which may account for my writing to you from the CustomHouse
 It is the most ungenial place in the whole world to write alove-letter in:--not but what my heart is full of love, here aselsewhere: but it closes up, and will not give forth its treasure now
I do wish mine own Dove had been with me, on my last passage to
 We should assuredly have thought that a miracle had beenwrought in our favor--that Providence had put angelic sentinels roundabout us, to ensure us the quiet enjoyment of our affection--for, asfar as Lynn, I was actually the sole occupant of the car in which Ihad seated myself
 What a blissful solitude would that have been, hadmy whole self been there! Then would we have flown through space liketwo disembodied spirits--two or one
 Are we singular or plural,dearest? Has not each of us a right to use the first person singular,when speaking in behalf of our united being? Does not "I," whetherspoken by Sophie Hawthorne's lips or mine, express the one spirit ofmyself and that darlingest Sophie Hawthorne? But what a wilful littleperson she is! Does she still refuse my Dove's proffer to kiss hercheek? Well--I shall contrive some suitable punishment: and if my Dovecannot kiss her, I must undertake the task in person
 What a painfulduty it will be!October 11th--½ past 4 P

 Did my Dove fly in with me in my chamberwhen I entered just now? If so, let her make herself manifest to methis very moment, for my heart needs her presence
--You are not heredearest
 I sit writing in the middle of the chamber, opposite thelooking-glass; and as soon as I finish this sentence, I shall looktherein--and really I have something like a shadowy notion, that Ishall behold mine own white Dove peeping over my shoulder
 One momentmore--I defer the experiment as long as possible, because there is apleasure in the slight tremor of the heart that this fantasy hasawakened
 Dearest, if you can make me sensible of your presence, do itnow!--Oh, naughty, naughty Dove! I have looked, and saw nothing but myown dark face and beetle-brow
 How could you disappoint me so? Or isit merely the defect in my own eyes, which cannot behold thespiritual? My inward eye can behold you, though but dimly
 Perhaps,beloved wife, you did not come when I called, because you mistook thelocality whence the call proceeded
 You are to know, then, that Ihave removed from my old apartment, which was wanted as a parlor byMr
 and Mrs
 Devens, and am now established in a back chamber--apleasant enough and comfortable little room
 The windows have a betterprospect than those of my former chamber, for I can see the summit ofthe hill on which Gardner Greene's estate was situated; it is thehighest point of the city, and the boys at play on it are paintedstrongly against the sky
 No roof ascends as high as this--nothing butthe steeple of the Park-street church, which points upward behind it
It is singular that such a hill should have been suffered to remain solong, in the very heart of the city; it affects me somewhat as if aportion of the original forest were still growing here
 But they arefast digging it away now; and if they continue their labors, I shallsoon be able to see the Park-street steeple as far downward as thedial
 Moreover, in another direction, I can see the top of the dome ofthe State-House; and if my Dove were to take wing and alight there(the easiest thing in the world for a dove to do) she might lookdirectly into my window, and see me writing this letter
 I glancethither as I write, but can see no Dove there

     Ownest Dove;Did you get home safe and sound, and with a quiet and happy heart?Providence acted lovingly toward us on Tuesday evening, allowing us tomeet in the wide desert of this world, and mingle our spirits
 Itwould have seemed all a vision then, now we have the symbol of itsreality
 You looked like a vision, beautifullest wife, with the widthof the room between us--so spiritual that my human heart wanted to beassured that you had an earthly vesture on
 What beautiful white dovesthose were, on the border of the vase; are they of mine own Dove'skindred? Do you remember a story of a cat who was changed into alovely lady?--and on her bridal night, a mouse happened to run acrossthe floor; and forthwith the cat-wife leaped out of bed to catch it
What if mine own Dove, in some woeful hour for her poor husband,should remember her dove-instincts, and spread her wings upon thewestern breeze, and return to him no more! Then would he stretch outhis arms, poor wingless biped, not having the wherewithal to fly, andsay aloud--"Come back, naughty Dove!--whither are you going?--comeback, and fold your wings upon my heart again, or it will freeze!" Andthe Dove would flutter her wings, and pause a moment in the air,meditating whether or no she should come back: for in truth, as herconscience would tell her, this poor mortal had given her all he hadto give--a resting-place on his bosom--a home in his deepest heart
But then she would say to herself--"my home is in the gladsomeair--and if I need a resting-place, I can find one on any of thesunset-clouds
 He is unreasonable to call me back; but if he canfollow me, he may!" Then would the poor deserted husband do his bestto fly in pursuit of the faithless Dove; and for that purpose wouldascend to the topmast of a salt-ship, and leap desperately into theair, and fall down head-foremost upon the deck, and break his neck
And there should be engraven on his tombstone--"Mate not thyself witha Dove, unless thou hast wings to fly
"Now will my Dove scold at me for this foolish flight of fancy;--butthe fact is, my goose quill flew away with me
 I do think that Ihave gotten a bunch of quills from the silliest flock of geese onearth
 But the rest of the letter shall be very sensible
 I saw Mr
Howes in the reading-room of [the] Athenaeum, between one and twoo'clock to-day; for I happened to have had leisure for an earlydinner, and so was spending a half-hour turning over the periodicals
He spoke of the long time since your husband had been at his house;and so I promised, on behalf of that respectable personage, that hewould spend an evening there on his next visit to Salem
 But if I hadsuch a sweetest wife as your husband has, I doubt whether I could find[it] in my heart to keep the engagement
 Now, good night, truest Dovein the world
 You will never fly away from me; and it is only theinfinite impossibility of it that enables me to sport with the idea
Dearest, there was an illegible word in your yesterday's note
 I havepored over it, but cannot make it out
 Your words are too precious tobe thus hidden under their own vesture
 Good night, wife!October 4th
--5 or thereabout P

 Mine own Dove, I dreamed thequeerest dreams last night, about being deserted, and all suchnonsense--so you see how I was punished for that naughty nonsense ofthe Faithless Dove
 It seems to me that my dreams are generally aboutfantasies, and very seldom about what I really think and feel
 You didnot appear visibly in my last night's dreams: but they were made up ofdesolation; and it was good to awake, and know that my spirit wasforever and irrevocably linked with the soul of my truest andtenderest Dove
 You have warmed my heart, mine own wife: and neveragain can I know what it is to be cold and desolate, save in dreams
You love me dearly--don't you?And so my Dove has been in great peril since we parted
 No--I do notbelieve she was; it was only a shadow of peril, not a reality
 Myspirit cannot anticipate any harm to you, and I trust you to God withsecurest faith
 I know not whether I could endure actually to see youin danger: but when I hear of any risk--as, for instance, when yoursteed seemed to be on the point of dashing you to pieces (but I doquake a little at that thought) against a tree--my mind does not seizeupon it as if it had any substance
 Believe me, dearest, the treewould have stood aside to let you pass, had there been no other meansof salvation
 Nevertheless, do not drive your steed against treeswilfully
 Mercy on us, what a peril that was of the fat woman, whenshe "smashed herself down" beside my Dove! Poor Dove! Did you not feelas if an avalanche had all but buried you
 I can see my Dove at thismoment, my slender, little delicatest white Dove, squeezed almost outof Christendom by that great mass of female flesh--that ton ofwoman--that beef-eater and beer-guzzler, whose immense cloak, thoughbroad as a ship's mainsail, could not be made to meet in front--thatpicture of an ale-wife--that triple, quadruple, dozen-fold old lady
Will not my Dove confess that there is a little nonsense in thisepistle? But be not wroth with me, darling wife;--my heart sports withyou because it loves you
If you happen to see Sophie Hawthorne, kiss her cheek for my sake
 Ilove her full as well as I do mine own wife
 Will that satisfy her, doyou think? If not, she is a very unreasonable little person
It is my chiefest pleasure to write to you, dearest
     YOUR OWNEST HUSBAND

     Dear little Dove,Here sits your husband, comfortably established for the evening in hisown domicile, with a cheerful coal fire making the room a little toowarm
 I think I like to be a very little too warm
 And now if my Dovewere here, she and that naughty Sophie Hawthorne, how happy we allthree--two--one--(how many are there of us?)--how happy might we be!Dearest, it will be a yet untasted bliss, when, for the first time, Ihave you in a domicile of my own, whether it be in a hut or a palace,a splendid suit of rooms or an attic chamber
 Then I shall feel as ifI had brought my wife home at last
 Shall Sophie Hawthorne be theretoo? Yes, mine own Dove, whether you like it or no
 You would wonder,were I to tell you how absolutely necessary she has contrived torender herself to your husband
 His heart stirs at her very name--evenat the thought of her unspoken name
 She is his sunshine--she is ahappy smile on the visage of his Destiny, causing that stern personageto look as benign as Heaven itself
 And were Sophie Hawthorne a tearinstead of a smile, still your foolish husband would hold out hisheart to receive that tear within it, and doubtless would think itmore precious than all the smiles and sunshine in the world
 ButSophie Hawthorne has bewitched him--for there is great reason tosuspect that she deals in magic
 Sometimes, while your husbandconceives himself to be holding his Dove in his arms, lo and behold!there is the arch face of Sophie Hawthorne peeping up at him
 Andagain, in the very midst of Sophie Hawthorne's airs, while he ismeditating what sort of chastisement would suit her misdemeanors, allof a sudden he becomes conscious of his Dove, with her wings foldedupon his heart to keep it warm
 Methinks a woman, or angel (yet let itbe a woman, because I deem a true woman holier than an angel)--methinks a woman, then, who should combine the characteristics ofSophie Hawthorne and my Dove would be the very perfection of her race
The heart would find all it yearns for, in such a woman, and so wouldthe mind and the fancy;--when her husband was lightsome of spirit,her merry fantasies would dance hand in hand with his; and when hewas overburthened with cares he would rest them all upon her bosom
Dearest, your husband was called on by Mr
 Hillard yesterday, who saidthat he intended soon to take a house in , and, in that case,would like to take your respectable spouse to lodge and breakfast
What thinks my Dove of this? Your husband is quite delighted, becausehe thinks matters may be managed so that once in a while he may meethis own wife within his own premises
 Might it not be so? Or would hiswife--most preposterous idea!--deem it a sin against decorum to pay avisit to her husband? Oh, no, belovedest
 Your unreserve, yourout-gushing frankness, is one of the loveliest results of your purity,and innocence, and holiness
 And now good night, wife worshipful andbeloved
 Amid many musings, nine o'clock has surprised me at thisstage of my epistle
October 24th
--½ past 6 P
M
 Dearest Dove, your letter came to-day;and I do think it the sweetest of all letters--but you must nottherefore suppose that you have excelled yourself; for I think thesame of each successive one
 My dearest, what a delightful scene wasthat between Sophie Hawthorne and my Dove, when the former rebelledso stoutly against Destiny, and the latter, with such meekmournfulness, submitted
 Which do I love the best, I wonder--my Dove,or my little Wild-Flower? I love each best, and both equally; and myheart would inevitably wither and dry up, and perish utterly, ifeither of them were torn away from it
 Yet, truly I have reason toapprehend more trouble with Sophie Hawthorne than with my Dove
          Custom House, Novr
 14th [1839]     My dearest Wife,May God sustain you under this affliction
 I have long dreaded it foryour sake
 Oh, let your heart be full of love for me now, and realisehow entirely my happiness depends on your well-being
 You are not yourown, dearest--you must not give way to grief
 Were it possible, Iwould come to see you now
I will write you again on Saturday
     YOUR OWN HUSBAND
My dearest, this note seems cold and lifeless to me, as if there wereno tenderness nor comfort in it
 Think for yourself all that I cannotspeak

 Belovedest, your yesterday's letter wasreceived; and gave me infinite comfort
 Yet, Oh, be prepared for theworst--if this may be called worst, which is in truth best forall--and more than all for George
 I cannot help trembling for you,dearest
 God bless you and keep you
I will write a full letter in a day or two
 Meantime, as your husbandis to rise with peep of day tomorrow, he must betake him to hismattress

 or thereabout
I received no letter from my sweetest wife yesterday; and my heart isnot quite at ease about her
 Dearest, I pray to God for you--and Ipray to yourself, too; for methinks there is within you a divine andmiraculous power to counteract all sorts of harm
 Oh be strong for thesake of your husband
 Let all your love for me be so much added to thestrength of your heart
 Remember that your anguish must likewise bemine
 Not that I would have it otherwise, mine own wife--your sorrowsshall be just as precious a possession to me as your joys
Dearest, if you could steal in upon your husband now, you would see acomfortable sight
 I wish you would make a sketch of me, here in ourown parlour; and it might be done without trusting entirely toimagination, as you have seen the room and the furniture--and (thoughthat would be the least important item of the picture) you have seenmyself
 I am writing now at my new bureau, which stands between thewindows; there are two lamps before me, which show the polishedshadings of the mahogany panels to great advantage
 A coal fire isburning in the grate--not a very fervid one, but flickering upfitfully, once in a while, so as to remind me that I am by my ownfireside
 I am sitting in the cane-bottomed rocking-chair (wherein myDove once sate, but which did not meet her approbation); and anotherhair-cloth arm-chair stands in front of the fire
 Would that I couldlook round with the assurance of seeing mine own white Dove in it! Notthat I want to see her apparition--nor to have her brought here bymiracle, but I want that full assurance of peace and joy, which Ishould have if my belovedest wife were near me in our own parlor
Sophie Hawthorne, what a beautiful carpet did you choose for me! Iadmire it so much that I can hardly bear to tread upon it
 It is fitonly to be knelt upon; and I do kneel on it sometimes
 As you saw itonly in narrow strips, I doubt whether even you can imagine what aneffect is produced by the tout ensemble, spreading its fantasticfoliage, or whatever it is, all over the floor
 Many times today haveI found myself gazing at it; and I am almost tempted to call in peoplefrom the street to help me admire it worthily
 But perhaps theywould not quite sympathize with my raptures
 I am doubtless somewhatmore alive to the merits of this carpet, because it was your choice,and is our mutual property
 My Dove, there is an excellent place for abust over the bookcase which surmounts my bureau; some time or other,I shall behold a creation of your own upon it
 At present, I have nowork of art to adorn our parlour with, except an allumette-holder, onthe mantel-piece ornamented with drawings from Flaxman
 It was givenme by Elizabeth; and, considerably to my vexation, one of the glasseshas been broken, during the recent removal of my household gods
My wife, I like sleeping on a mattress better than on a feather-bed
It is a pity, however, that a mattress looks so lean and lank;--itcertainly does not suggest such ideas of comfort and downy repose as awell-filled feather-bed does; but my sleep, I think, is of betterquality, though, indeed, there was nothing to complain of on thatscore, even while I reposed on feathers
 You need not be afraid of mysmothering in the little bed-room; for I always leave the door open,so that I have the benefit of the immense volume of air in thespacious parlor
Mrs
 Hillard takes excellent care of me, and feeds [me] with eggsand baked apples and other delectable dainties; and altogether I am ashappily situated as a man can be, whose heart is wedded, whileexternally he is still a bachelor
My wife, would you rather that I should come home next Saturday andstay till Monday, or that I should come to Thanksgiving and stay therest of the week? Both I cannot do; but I will try to do the latter,if you wish it; and I think I shall finish the salt-ship which I amnow engaged upon, about Thanksgiving time--unless foul weatherintervene to retard our progress
 How delightfully long the eveningsare now! I do not get intolerably tired any longer; and my thoughtssometimes wander back to literature and I have momentary impulses towrite stories
 But this will not be, at present
 The utmost that I canhope to do, will be to portray some of the characteristics of the lifewhich I am now living, and of the people with whom I am brought intocontact, for future use
 I doubt whether I shall write any more forthe public, till I can have a daily or nightly opportunity ofsubmitting my productions to the criticism of Sophie Hawthorne
 I havea high opinion of that young lady's critical acumen, but a great dreadof her severity--which, however, the Dove will not fail to temper withher sweetness
Dearest, there is nothing at all in this letter; and perhaps it maycome to you at a time when your heart needs the strongest, andtenderest, and most comfortable words that mine can speak to it
 Yetwhat could I say, but to assure you that I love you, and partakewhatever of good or evil God sends you--or rather, partake whatevergood God sends you, whether it come in festal garments or mourningones; for still it is good, whether arrayed in sable, orflower-crowned
 God bless you, belovedest,     YOUR OWNEST HUSBAND

, [1839]     Belovedest Wife,My heart bids me to send you a greeting; and therefore I do it,although I do not feel as if I had many thoughts and words at commandtonight, but only feelings and sympathies, which must find their wayto you as well as they can
 Dearest, I cannot bear to think of yousitting all day long in that chamber, and not a soul to commune withyou
 But I endeavor, and will still endeavor, to send my soul thither,from out of the toil and tedium of my daily life;--so think, beloved,whenever solitude and sad thoughts become intolerable, that, just atthat moment I am near you, and trying to comfort you and make yousensible of my presence
Beloved, it occurs to me, that my earnest entreaties to you to be calmand strong may produce an effect not altogether good
 The behests ofNature may perhaps differ from mine, and be wiser
 If she bids youshed tears, methinks it will be best to let them flow, and then yourgrief will melt quietly forth, instead of being pent up till it breaksout in a torrent
 But I cannot speak my counsel to you, dearest, sodecidedly as if I were with you; for then my heart would know all thestate of yours, and what it needed
 But love me infinitely, my wife,and rest your heart with all its heaviness on mine
 I know not whatelse to say;--but even that is saying something--is it not, dearest?I rather think, beloved, that I shall come home on Saturday night, andtake my chance of being able to come again on Thanksgiving-day
 Butthen I shall not be able to remain the rest of the week
 That you wantme I know; and, dearest, my head and heart are weary with absence fromyou; so that it will be best to snatch the first chance that offers
Soon, mine own wife, I shall be able to spend much more time with you

, [1839]Dearest, you know not how your blessed letter strengthens my heart onyour account; for I know by it that God and the angels are supportingyou
 And, mine own wife, though I thought that I reverenced youinfinitely before, yet never was so much of that feeling mingled withmy love, as now
 You are yourself one of the angels who minister toyour departing brother--the more an angel, because you triumph overearthly weakness to perform those offices of affection
 I feel, now,with what confidence I can rest upon you in all my sorrows andtroubles--as confident of your strength as of your love
 Dearest,there is nothing in me worthy of you
 My heart is weak in comparisonwith yours
 Its strength, it is true, has never been tried; for I havenever been called to minister at the dying bed of a dear friend; but Ihave often thought, that, in such a scene, I should need support fromthe dying, instead of being able to give it
 I bless God that He hasmade Death so beautiful as he appears in the scene which youdescribe--that He has caused the light from the other side to shineover and across the chasm of the grave
My wife, my spirit has never yearned for communion with you so much asit does now
 I long to hold you on my bosom--to hold you theresilently--for I have no words to write my sympathy, and should havenone to speak them
 Sometimes, even after all I have now learned ofyour divine fortitude, I feel as if I shall dread to meet you, lest Ishould find you quite worn down by this great trial
 But, dearest, Iwill make up my mind to see you pale, and thinner than you were
 Onlydo not be sick--do not give me too much to bear

 Mine own Dove, your fourth letter cametoday, and all the rest were duly received, and performed theirheaven-appointed mission to my soul
 The last has left a very cheeringinfluence on my spirit
 Dearest, I love that naughty Sophie Hawthornewith an unspeakable affection, and bless God for her every minute; forwhat my Dove could do without her, passes my comprehension
 And, mineown wife, I have not been born in vain, but to an end worth livingfor, since you are able to rest your heart on me, and are therebysustained in this sorrow, and enabled to be a help and comfort to yourmother, and a ministering angel to George
 Give my love to George
 Iregret that we have known each other so little in life; but there willbe time enough hereafter--in that pleasant region "on the other side
"Beloved, I shall come on Saturday, but probably not till the fiveo'clock train, unless it should storm; so you must not expect me tillseven or thereabouts
 I never did yearn for you so much as now
 Thereis a feeling in me as if a great while had passed since we met
 Is itso with you?The days are cold now, the air eager and nipping--yet it suits myhealth amazingly
 I feel as if I could run a hundred miles at astretch, and jump over all the houses that happen to be in my way
Belovedest, I must bring this letter to a close now, for severalreasons--partly that I may carry it to the Post-Office before itcloses; for I hate to make your father pay the postage of my wife'sletters
 Also, I have another short letter of business to write;--and,moreover, I must go forth into the wide world to seek my supper
 Thislife of mine is the perfection of a bachelor-life--so perfectlyuntrammelled as it is
 Do you not fear, my wife, to trust me to livein such a way any longer?Belovedest, still keep up your heart for your husband's sake
 I prayto God for quiet sleeps for my Dove, and cheerful awakings--yes,cheerful; for Death moves with a sweet aspect into your household; andyour brother passes away with him as with a friend
 And now farewell,dearest of wives
 You are the hope and joy of your husband's heart
Never, never forget how very precious you are to him
 God bless you,dearest

     Belovedest Wife,This very day I have held you in my arms; and yet, now that I findmyself again in my solitary room, it seems as if a long while hadalready passed--long enough, as I trust my Dove will think, to excusemy troubling her with an epistle
 I came off in the two o'clock cars,through such a pouring rain, that doubtless Sophie Hawthorne set itdown for certain that I should pass the day and night in Salem
 Andperhaps she and the Dove are now watching, with beating heart, to hearyour husband lift the door-latch
 Alas, that they must bedisappointed! Dearest, I feel that I ought to be with you now; for itgrieves me to imagine you all alone in that chamber, where you "sitand wait"--as you said to me this morning
 This, I trust, is thelast of your sorrow, mine own wife; in which you will not have all theaid that your husband's bosom, and the profoundest sympathy thatexists within it, can impart
I found your letter in the Measurer's Desk; and though I knewperfectly well that it was there, and had thought of it repeatedly,yet it struck me with a sense of unexpectedness when I saw it
 I putit in my breast-pocket, and did not open it till I found myselfcomfortably settled for the evening; for I took my supper of oysterson my way to my room, and have nothing to do with the busy world tillsunrise tomorrow
 Oh, mine own beloved, it seems to me the only thingworth living for that I have ever done, or been instrumental in, thatGod has made me the means of saving you from the heaviest anguish ofyour brother's loss
 Ever, ever, dearest wife, keep my image, orrather my reality, between yourself and pain of every kind
 Let meclothe you in my love as in an armour of proof--let me wrap my spiritround about your own, so that no earthly calamity may come inimmediate contact with it, but be felt, if at all, through a softeningmedium
 And it is a blessed privilege, and even a happy one, to givesuch sympathy as my Dove requires--happy to give--and, dearest, is itnot also happiness to receive it? Our happiness consists in our senseof the union of our hearts--and has not that union been far moredeeply felt within us now, than if all our ties were those of joy andgladness? Thus may every sorrow leave us happier than it found us, bycausing our hearts to embrace more closely in the mutual effort tosustain it
Dearest, I pray God that your strength may not fail you at the closeof this scene
 My heart is not quite at rest about you
 It seems tome, on looking back, that there was a vague inquietude within me allthrough this last visit; and this it was, perhaps, that made me seemmore sportive than usual
Did I tell my carefullest little wife that I had bought me a fur cap,wherewith my ears may bid defiance to the wintry blast--a poor image,by the way, to talk of ears bidding defiance
 The nose might do it,because it is capable of emitting sounds like a trumpet--indeed,Sophie Hawthorne's nose bids defiance without any sound
 But whatnonsense this is
 Also (I have now been a married man long enough tofeel these details perfectly natural, in writing to my wife) yourhusband, having a particular dislike to flannel, is resolved, everycold morning, to put on two shirts, and has already done so on oneoccasion, wonderfully to his comfort
 Perhaps--but this I leave toSophie Hawthorne's judgment--it might be well to add a daily shirtto my apparel as the winter advances, and to take them off again, oneby one, with the approach of spring
 Dear me, what a puffed-out heapof cotton-bagging would your husband be, by the middle of January! HisDove would strive in vain to fold her wings around him
My beloved, this is Thanksgiving week
 Do you remember how we wereemployed, or what our state of feeling was, at this time last year? Ihave forgotten how far we had advanced into each other's hearts--orrather, how conscious we had become that we were mutually within oneanother--but I am sure we were already dearest friends
 But now oureyes are opened
 Now we know that we have found all in each other--allthat life has to give--and a foretaste of eternity
 At every formerThanksgiving-day I have been so ungrateful to Heaven as to feel thatsomething was wanting, and that my life so far had been abortive; andtherefore, I fear, there has often been repining instead ofthankfulness in my heart
 Now I can thank God that he has given me myDove, and all the world in her
 I wish, dearest, that we could eat ourThanksgiving dinner together; and were it nothing but your bowl ofbread and milk, we would both of us be therewith content
 But I mustsit at our mother's table
 One of these days, sweetest wife, we willinvite her to our own
Will my Dove expect a letter from me so soon? I have written thisevening, because I expect to be engaged tomorrow--moreover, my heartbade me write

     Blessedest wife,Does our head ache this evening?--and has it ached all or any of thetime to-day? I wish I knew, dearest, for it seems almost too great ablessing to expect, that my Dove should come quite safe through thetrial which she has encountered
 Do, mine own wife, resume all yourusual occupations as soon as possible--your sculpture, your painting,your music (what a company of sister-arts is combined in the littleperson of my Dove!)--and above all, your riding and walking
 Writeoften to your husband, and let your letters gush from a cheerfulheart; so shall they refresh and gladden me, like draughts from asparkling fountain, which leaps from some spot of earth where no gravehas ever been dug
 Dearest, for some little time to come, I pray younot to muse too much upon your brother, even though such musingsshould be untinged with gloom, and should appear to make you happier
In the eternity where he now dwells, it has doubtless become of noimportance to himself whether he died yesterday, or a thousand yearsago; he is already at home in the celestial city--more at home thanever he was in his mother's house
 Then, my beloved, let us leave himthere for the present; and if the shadows and images of this fleetingtime should interpose between us and him, let us not seek to drivethem away, for they are sent of God
 By and bye, it will be good andprofitable to commune with your brother's spirit; but so soon afterhis release from mortal infirmity, it seems even ungenerous towardshimself, to call him back by yearnings of the heart and too vividpicturings of what he was
Little Dove, why did you shed tears the other day, when you supposedthat your husband thought you to blame for regretting the irrevocablepast? Dearest, I never think you to blame; for you positively have nofaults
 Not that you always act wisely, or judge wisely, or feelprecisely what it would be wise to feel, in relation to this presentworld and state of being; but it is because you are too delicately andexquisitely wrought in heart, mind, and frame, to dwell in such aworld--because, in short, you are fitter to be in Paradise than here
You needed, therefore, an interpreter between the world andyourself--one who should sometimes set you right, not in the abstract(for there you are never wrong) but relatively to human and earthlymatters;--and such an interpreter is your husband, who can sympathise,though inadequately, with his wife's heavenly nature, and has likewisea portion of shrewd earthly sense, enough to guide us both through thelabyrinths of time
 Now, dearest, when I criticise any act, word,thought, or feeling of yours, you must not understand it as a reproof,or as imputing anything wrong, wherewith you are to burthen yourconscience
 Were an angel, however holy and wise, to come and dwellwith mortals, he would need the guidance and instruction of somemortal; and so will you, my Dove, need mine--and precisely the samesort of guidance that the angel would
 Then do not grieve, nor grieveyour husband's spirit, when he essays to do his office; but rememberthat he does it reverently, and in the devout belief that you are, inimmortal reality, both wiser and better than himself, though sometimeshe may chance to interpret the flitting shadows around us moreaccurately than you
 Hear what I say, dearest, in a cheerful spirit,and act upon it with cheerful strength
 And do not give an undueweight to my judgment, nor imagine that there is no appeal from it,and that its decrees are not to be questioned
 Rather, make it a rulealways to question them and be satisfied of their correctness;--and soshall my Dove be improved and perfected in the gift of a humanunderstanding, till she become even earthly-wiselier than hersagacious husband
 Undine's husband gave her an immortal soul; mybeloved wife must be content with an humbler gift from me, beingalready provided with as high and pure a soul as ever was created

 Belovedest andblessedest, I cannot feel anything but comfort in you
 Rest quietly onmy deep, deep, deepest affection
 You deserve it all, and infinitelymore than all, were it only for the happiness you give me

     My Dearest,The day must not pass without my speaking a word or two to mybelovedest wife, of whom I have thought, with tender anxieties mingledwith comfortable hopes, all day long
 Dearest, is your heart at peacenow? God grant it--and I have faith that He will communicate the peaceof my heart to yours
 Mine own wife, always when there is troublewithin you, let your husband know of it
 Strive to fling your burthenupon me; for there is strength enough in me to bear it all, and loveenough to make me happy in bearing it
 I will not give up any of myconjugal rights--and least of all this most precious right ofministering to you in all sorrow
 My bosom was made, among otherpurposes, for mine ownest wife to shed tears upon
 This I have known,ever since we were married--and I had yearnings to be your support andcomforter, even before I knew that God was uniting our spirits inimmortal wedlock
 I used to think that it would be happiness enough,food enough for my heart, it I could be the life-long, familiar friendof your family, and be allowed to see yourself every evening, and towatch around you to keep harm away--though you might never know whatan interest I felt in you
 And how infinitely more than this has beengranted me! Oh, never dream, blessedest wife, that you can be otherthan a comfort to your husband--or that he can be disappointed in you
Mine own Dove, I hardly know how it is, but nothing that you do or sayever surprises or disappoints me; it must be that my spirit is sothoroughly and intimately conscious of you, that there exists latentwithin me a prophetic knowledge of all your vicissitudes of joy orsorrow; so that, though I cannot foretell them before-hand, yet Irecognize them when they come
 Nothing disturbs the preconceived ideaof you in my mind
 Whether in bliss or agony, still you are mine ownDove--still my blessing--still my peace
 Belovedest, since theforegoing sentence, I have been interrupted; so I will leave the restof the sheet till tomorrow evening
 Good night, and in writing thesewords my soul has flown through the air to give you a fondest kiss
Did you not feel it?Decr

 Well, I am afraid I shall never find in myheart to call that excellent little person "Naughty" again--no; and Ihave even serious thoughts of giving up all further designs upon hernose, since she hates so much to have it kissed
 Yet the poor littlenose!--would it not be quite depressed (I do not mean flattened) by myneglect, after becoming accustomed to such marked attention? Andbesides, I have a particular affection for that nose, insomuch that Iintend, one of these days, to offer it an oblation of rich anddelicate odours
 But I suppose Sophie Hawthorne would apply herhandkerchief, so that the poor nose should reap no pleasure nor profitfrom my incense
 Naughty Sophie Hawthorne! There--I have called her"naughty" already--and on a mere supposition, too
Half a page of nonsense about Sophie Hawthorne's nose! And now have Ianything to say to my little Dove? Yes--a reproof
 My Dove is tounderstand, that she entirely exceeds her jurisdiction, in presumingto sit in judgment upon herself, and pass such severe censure as shedid upon her Friday's letter--or indeed any censure at all
 It washer bounden duty to write that letter; for it was the cry of herheart, which ought and must have reached her husband's ears, whereverin the world he might be
 And yet you call it wicked
 Was it SophieHawthorne or the Dove that called it so? Naughty SophieHawthorne--naughty Dove--for I believe they are both partakers of thisnaughtiness
Dearest, I have never had the good luck to profit much, or indeed any,by attending lectures; so that I think the ticket had better bebestowed on somebody who can listen to Mr
 Emerson more worthily
 Myevenings are very precious to me; and some of them are unavoidablythrown away in paying or receiving visits, or in writing letters ofbusiness; and therefore I prize the rest as if the sands of thehour-glass were gold or diamond dust
 I have no other time to sit inmy parlor (let me call it ours) and be happy by our ownfireside--happy in reveries about a certain little wife of mine, whowould fain have me spend my evenings in hearing lectures, lest Ishould incommode her with too frequent epistles
Good bye, dearest
 I suppose I have left a dozen questions in yourletter unanswered; but you shall ask them again when we meet
 Do notyou long to see me? Mercy on us,--what a pen! It looks as if I hadlaid a strong emphasis on that sentence
 God bless my Dove, and SophieHawthorne too
--So prays their ownest husband

     Dearest wife,I do wish that you would evince the power of your spirit over itsoutward manifestations, in some other way than by raising aninflammation over your eye
 Do, belovedest, work another miracleforthwith, and cause this mountain--for I fancy it as of reallymountainous bulk--cause it to be cast into the sea, or anywhere else;so that both eyes may greet your husband, when he comes home
Otherwise, I know not but my eyes will have an inflammation too;--theycertainly smarted in a very unwonted manner, last evening
 "Thenaughty swelling!" as my Dove (or Sophie Hawthorne) said of theswollen cheek that afflicted me last summer
 Will kisses have anyefficacy? No; I am afraid not, for if they were medicinal, my Dove'seyelids have been so imbued with them that no ill would have comethere
 Nevertheless, though not a preventive, a kiss may chance tobe a remedy
 Can Sophie Hawthorne be prevailed upon to let me try it?I went to see my wife's (and of course my own) sister Mary, on Tuesdayevening
 She appeared very well; and we had a great deal of good talk,wherein my Dove was not utterly forgotten--(now will Sophie Hawthorne,thinking the Dove slighted, pout her lip at that expression)--wellthen, my Dove was directly or indirectly concerned in all my thoughts,and most of my words
 Mrs
 Park was not there, being gone, I believe,to some lecture
 Mary and your husband talked with the utmosthopefulness and faith of my Dove's future health and well-being
Dearest, you are well (all but the naughty swelling) and you alwayswill be well
 I love Mary because she loves you so much;--ouraffections meet in you, and so we become kindred
 But everybody lovesmy Dove--everybody that knows her--and those that know her not loveher also, though unconsciously, whenever they image to themselvessomething sweeter, and tenderer, and nobler, than they can meet withon earth
 It is the likeness of my Dove that has haunted the dreams ofpoets, ever since the world began
 Happy me, to whom that dream hasbecome the reality of all realities--whose bosom has been warmed, andis forever warmed, with the close embrace of her who has flittedshadowlike away from all other mortals! Dearest, I wish your husbandhad the gift of making rhymes; for methinks there is poetry in hishead and heart, since he has been in love with you
 You are a Poem, myDove
 Of what sort, then? Epic?--Mercy on me,--no! A sonnet?--no; forthat is too labored and artificial
 My Dove is a sort of sweet,simple, gay, pathetic ballad, which Nature is singing, sometimes withtears, sometimes with smiles, and sometimes with intermingled smilesand tears
I was invited to dine at Mr
 Bancroft's yesterday with Miss MargaretFuller; but Providence had given me some business to do; for which Iwas very thankful
 When my Dove and Sophie Hawthorne can go with me, Ishall not be afraid to accept invitations to meet literary lions andlionesses, because then I shall put the above-said redoubtable littlepersonage in the front of the battle
 What do you think, Dearest, ofthe expediency of my making a caucus speech? A great many people arevery desirous of listening to your husband's eloquence; and that isconsidered the best method of making my debut
 Now, probably, willSophie Hawthorne utterly refuse to be kissed, unless I give up allnotion of speechifying at a caucus
 Silly little Sophie!--I wouldnot do it, even if thou thyself besought it of me
Belovedest, I wish, before declining your ticket to Mr
 Emerson'slectures, that I had asked whether you wished me to attend them; forif you do, I should have more pleasure in going, than if the wish wereoriginally my own
Dearest wife, nobody can come within the circle of my loneliness, saveyou;--you are my only companion in the world;--at least, when Icompare other intercourse with our intimate communion, it seems as[if] other people were the world's width asunder
 And yet I love allthe world better for my Dove's sake
Good bye, belovedest
 Drive away that "naughty swelling
"     YOUR OWNEST HUSBAND
Do not expect me till seven o'clock on Saturday--as I shall not leave till sunset
          , Decr

M
     Belovedest,I am afraid you will expect a letter tomorrow--afraid, because I feelvery sure that I shall not be able to fill this sheet tonight
 I amwell, and happy, and I love you dearly, sweetest wife;--nevertheless,it is next to impossibility for me to put ideas into words
 Even inwriting these two or three lines, I have fallen into several long fitsof musing
 I wish there was something in the intellectual worldanalogous to the Daguerrotype (is that the name of it?) in thevisible--something which should print off our deepest, and subtlest,and delicatest thoughts and feelings as minutely and accurately as theabove-mentioned instrument paints the various aspects of Nature
 Thenmight my Dove and I interchange our reveries--but my Dove would getonly lead in exchange for gold
 Dearest, your last letter brought thewarmth of your very heart to your husband--Belovedest, I cannotpossibly write one word more, to-night
This striving to talk on paper does but remove you farther from me
 Itseems as if Sophie Hawthorne fled away into infinite space the momentI try to fix her image before me in order to inspire my pen;--whereas,no sooner do I give myself up to reverie, than here she is again,smiling lightsomely by my side
 There will be no writing of letters inHeaven; at least, I shall write none then, though I think it would addconsiderably to my bliss to receive them from my Dove
 Never was I sostupid as to-night;--and yet it is not exactly stupidity, either, formy fancy is bright enough, only it has, just at this time, no commandof external symbols
 Good night, dearest wife
 Love your husband, anddream of him
Decr
 12th--6 P

 Blessedest--Dove-ward and Sophie Hawthorne-warddoth your husband acknowledge himself "very reprehensible," forleaving his poor wife destitute of news from him such an interminabletime--one, two, three, four days tomorrow noon
 After seven years'absence, without communication, a marriage, if I mistake not, isdeemed to be legally dissolved
 Does it not appear at least sevenyears to my Dove, since we parted? It does to me
 And will my Dove, ornaughty Sophie Hawthorne, choose to take advantage of the law, anddeclare our marriage null and void? Oh, naughty, naughty, naughtiestSophie Hawthorne, to suffer such an idea to come into your head! TheDove, I am sure, would not disown her husband, but would keep herheart warm with faith and love for a million of years; so that when hereturned to her (as he surely would, at some period of Eternity, tospend the rest of eternal existence with her) he would seem to find inher bosom the warmth which his parting embrace had left there
Very dearest, I do wish you would come to see me, this evening
 If wecould be together in this very parlour of ours, I think you, and bothof us, would feel more completely at home than we ever have before inall our lives
 Your chamber is but a room in your mother's house,where my Dove cannot claim an independent and separate right; she hasa right, to be sure, but it is as a daughter
 As a wife, it might be aquestion whether she has a right
 Now this pleasant little room, whereI sit, together with the bed-room in which I intend to dream tonightof my Dove, is my dwelling, my castle, mine own place wherein to be,which I have bought, for the time being, with the profits of mine ownlabor
 Then is it not our home?     (Rest of letter missing)     , Decr
 18th, 1839--nearly 7 P
M
     Belovedest,I wish you could see our parlour to-night--how bright and cheerful itlooks, with the blaze of the coal-fire throwing a ruddy tinge over thewalls, in spite of the yellow gleam of two lamps
 Now if my Dove weresitting in the easiest of our two easy chairs--(for sometimes I shouldchoose to have her sit in a separate chair, in order to realise ourindividuality, as well as our unity)--then would the included space ofthese four walls, together with the little contiguous bed-room, seemindeed like home
--But the soul of home is wanting now
 Oh,naughtiest, why are you not here to welcome your husband when he comesin at eventide, chilled with his wintry day's toil? Why does he notfind the table placed cosily in front of the fire, and a cup of teasteaming fragrantly--or else a bowl of warm bread and milk, such ashis Dove feeds upon? A much-to-be-pitied husband am I, naughtywife--a homeless man--a wanderer in the desert of this great city;picking up a precarious subsistence wherever I happen to find arestaurateur or an oyster-shop--and returning at night to a lonelyfireside
 Dearest, have I brought the tears into your eyes? What anunwise little person is my Dove, to let the tears gather in her eyesfor such nonsensical pathos as this! Yet not nonsensical either,inasmuch as it is a sore trial to your husband to be estranged fromthat which makes life a reality to him, and to be compelled to spendso many God-given days in a dream--in an outward show, which hasnothing to satisfy the soul that has become acquainted with truth
But, mine own wife, if you had not taught me what happiness is, Ishould not have known that there is anything lacking to me now
 I amdissatisfied--not because, at any former period of my life, I was evera thousandth part so happy as now--but because Hope feeds and growsstrong on the happiness within me
 Good night, belovedest wife
 I havea note to write to Mr
 Capen, who torments me every now-and-then abouta book which he wants me to manufacture
 Hereafter, I intend that myDove shall manage all my correspondence:--indeed, it is my purpose tothrow all sorts of trouble upon my Dove's shoulders
 Good night now,dearest
--December 20th--7 P
M
 Blessedest wife--has not Sophie Hawthorne beenvery impatient for this letter, one half of which yet remainsundeveloped in my brain and heart? Would that she could enter thoseinward regions, and read the letter there--together with so much thatnever can be expressed in written or spoken words
 And can she not dothis? The Dove can do it, even if Sophie Hawthorne fail
 Dearest,would it be unreasonable for me to ask you to manage my share of thecorrespondence, as well as your own?--to throw yourself into my heart,and make it gush out with more warmth and freedom than my own pen canavail to do? How I should delight to see an epistle from myself toSophie Hawthorne, written by my Dove!--or to my Dove, Sophie Hawthornebeing the amanuensis! I doubt not, that truths would then be spoken,which my heart would recognise as existing within its depths, yetwhich can never be clothed in words of my own
 You know that we areone another's consciousness--then it is not poss--My dearest, GeorgeHillard has come in upon me, in the midst of the foregoing sentence,and I have utterly forgotten what I meant to say
 But it is not muchmatter
 Even if I could convince you of the expediency of yourwriting my letters as well as your own, still, when you attempted totake the pen out of my hand, I believe I should resist verystrenuously
 For, belovedest, though not an epistolarian by nature,yet the instinct of communicating myself to you makes it a necessityand a joy to write
Your husband has received an invitation, through Mr
 CollectorBancroft, to go to Dr
 Channing's to-night
 What is to be done?Anything, rather than to go
 I never will venture into company, unlessI can put myself under the protection of Sophie Hawthorne
 She, I amsure, will take care that no harm comes to me
 Or my Dove might takeme "under her wing
"Dearest, you must not expect me too fervently on Christmas eve,because it is very uncertain whether Providence will bring us togetherthen
 If not, I shall take care to advise you thereof byletter--which, however, may chance not to come to hand till threeo'clock on Christmas day
 And there will be my Dove, making herselfnervous with waiting for me
 Dearest, I wish I could be the source ofnothing but happiness to you--and that disquietude, hope deferred, anddisappointment, might not ever have aught to do with your affection
Does the joy compensate for the pain? Naughty Sophie Hawthorne--sillyDove--will you let that foolish question bring tears into your eyes?My Dove's letter was duly received
     Your lovingest     HUSBAND

     My very dearest,While I sit down disconsolately to write this letter, at this verymoment is my Dove expecting to hear her husband's footstep upon thethreshold
 She fully believes, that, within the limits of the hourwhich is now passing, she will be clasped to my bosom
 Belovedest, Icannot bear to have you yearn for me so intensely
 By and bye, whenyou find that I do not come, our head will begin to ache;--but still,being the "hopingest little person" in the world, you will not give meup, perhaps till eight o'clock
 But soon it will be bed-time--it willbe deep night--and not a spoken word, not a written line, will havecome to your heart from your naughtiest of all husbands
 SophieHawthorne, at least, will deem him the naughtiest of husbands; but myDove will keep her faith in him just as firmly and fervently, as ifshe were acquainted with the particular impossibilities which keephim from her
 Dearest wife, I did hope, till this afternoon, that Ishould be able to disburthen myself of the cargo of salt which hasbeen resting on my weary shoulders for a week past; but it does seemas if Heaven's mercy were not meant for us miserable Custom-Houseofficers
 The holiest of holydays--the day that brought ransom to allother sinners--leaves us in slavery still
Nevertheless, dearest, if I did not feel two disappointments inone--your own and mine--I should feel much more comfortable andresigned than I do
 If I could have come to you to-night, I mustinevitably have returned hither tomorrow evening
 But now, in requitalof my present heaviness of spirit, I am resolved that my next visitshall be at least one day longer than I could otherwise have venturedto make it
 We cannot spend this Christmas eve together, mine ownwife; but I have faith that you will see me on the eve of the NewYear
 Will not you be glad when I come home to spend three whole days,that I was kept away from you for a few brief hours on Christmas eve?For if I went now, I could not be with you then
My blessedest, write and let me know that you have not been very muchdisturbed by my non-appearance
 I pray you to have the feelings of awife towards me, dearest--that is, you must feel that my whole life isyours, a life-time of long days, and therefore it is no irreparablenor very grievous loss, though sometimes a few of those days arewasted away from you
 A wife should be calm and quiet, in the settledcertainty of possessing her husband
 Above all, dearest, bear thesecrosses with philosophy for my sake; for it makes me anxious anddepressed, to imagine your anxiety and depression
 Oh, that you couldbe very joyful when I come, and yet not sad when I fail to come! Isthat impossible, my sweetest Dove?--is it impossible, my naughtiestSophie Hawthorne?Your husband's heart was exceedingly touched by that little backhandednote, and likewise by the bundle of allumettes--half a dozen of whichI have just been kissing with great affection
 Would that I might kissthat poor dear finger of mine! Kiss it for my sake, sweetest Dove--andtell naughty Sophie Hawthorne to kiss it too
 Nurse it well, dearest;for no small part of my comfort and cheeriness of heart depends uponthat beloved finger
 If it be not well enough to bear its part inwriting me a letter within a few days, do not be surprised if I senddown the best surgeon in  to effect a speedy cure
 Nevertheless,darlingest wife, restrain the good little finger, if it show anyinclination to recommence its labors too soon
 If your finger bepained in writing, your husband's heart ought to (and I hope would)feel every twinge
Belovedest, I have not yet wished you a Happy New Year! And yet Ihave--many, many of them; as many, mine own wife, as we can enjoytogether--and when we can no more enjoy them together, we shall nolonger think of Happy New Years on earth, but look longingly for theNew Year's Day of eternity
 What a year the last has been! Dearest,you make the same exclamation; but my heart originates it too
 It hasbeen the year of years--the year in which the flower of our life hasbloomed out--the flower of our life and of our love, which we are towear in our bosoms forever
 Oh, how I love you, belovedest wife!--andhow I thank God that He has made me capable to know and love you!Sometimes I feel, deep, deep down in my heart, how dearest above allthings you are to me; and those are blissful moments
 It is such ahappiness to be conscious, at last, of something real
 All my lifehitherto, I have been walking in a dream, among shadows which couldnot be pressed to my bosom; but now, even in this dream of time, thereis something that takes me out of it, and causes me to be a dreamer nomore
 Do you not feel, dearest, that we live above time and apart fromtime, even while we seem to be in the midst of time? Our affectiondiffuses eternity round about us
My carefullest little wife will rejoice to know that I have been freeto sit by a good fire all this bitter cold day--not but what I have asalt-ship on my hands, but she must have some ballast, before she candischarge any more salt; and ballast cannot be procured till the dayafter tomorrow
 Are not these details very interesting? I have a mind,some day, to send my dearest a journal of all my doings andsufferings, my whole external life, from the time I awake at dawn,till I close my eyes at night
 What a dry, dull history would it be!But then, apart from this, I would write another journal of my inwardlife throughout the self-same day--my fits of pleasant thought, andthose likewise which are shadowed by passing clouds--the yearnings ofmy heart towards my Dove--my pictures of what we are to enjoytogether
 Nobody would think that the same man could live two suchdifferent lives simultaneously
 But then, as I have said above, thegrosser life is a dream, and the spiritual life a reality
Very dearest, I wish you would make out a list of books that you wouldlike to be in our library; for I intend, whenever the cash and theopportunity occur together, to buy enough to fill up our newbook-case; and I want to feel that I am buying them for both of us
When I next come to Salem, you shall read the list, and we willdiscuss it, volume by volume
 I suppose the book-case will holdabout two hundred volumes; but you need not calculate upon making sucha vast collection all at once
 It shall be accomplished in small lots;and then we shall prize every volume, and receive a separate pleasurefrom the acquisition of it
Does it seem a great while since I left you, dearest? Truly, it doesto me
 These separations lengthen our earthly lives by at leastnine-tenths; but then, in our brief seasons of communion, there is theessence of a thousand years
 Was it Thursday that I told my Dove wouldbe the day of my next appearance?--or Friday? "Oh, Friday, certainly!"says Sophie Hawthorne
 Well; it must be as naughty Sophie says
Oh, belovedest, I want you
 You have given me a new feeling,blessedest wife--a sense, that strong as I may have deemed myself, Iam insufficient for my own support; and that there is a tender littleDove, without whose help I cannot get through this weary world at all
God bless you, ownest wife
     YOUR OWNEST HUSBAND
What a best of all possible husbands you have, sweetest wife, to bewriting to you so soon again, although he has heard nothing from yousince the latter part of the year 1839! What a weary length of timethat naughty finger has been ill! Unless there are signs of speedyamendment, we must begin to think of "rotation in office," and theleft hand must be nominated to the executive duties of which the rightis no longer capable
 Yet, dearest, do not imagine that I amimpatient
 I do indeed long to see your delicatest little penmanship;(what an enormity it would be to call my Dove's most feminine ofhandwritings penmanship!) but it would take away all the happinessof it, when I reflected that each individual letter had been a pain toyou
 Nay; I would not have you write, if you find that the impedimentsof this mode of utterance check the flow of your mind and heart
But you tell me that the wounded finger will be no hindrance to yourpainting
 Very glad am I, dearest; for you cannot think how muchdelight those pictures are going to give me
 I shall sit and gaze atthem whole hours together--and these will be my happiest hours, thefullest of you, though all are full of you
 I never owned a picture inmy life; yet pictures have always been among the earthly possessions(and they are spiritual possessions too) which I most coveted
 I knownot what value my Dove's pictures might bear at an auction-room; butto me, certainly, they will be incomparably more precious than all theproductions of all the painters since Apelles
 When we live togetherin our own home, belovedest, we will paint pictures together--that is,our minds and hearts shall unite to form the conception, to which yourhand shall give material existence
 I have often felt as if I could bea painter, only I am sure that I could never handle a brush;--now myDove will show me the images of my inward eye, beautified andetherealised by the mixture of her own spirit
 Belovedest, I think Ishall get these two pictures put into mahogany frames, because theywill harmonize better with the furniture of our parlor than giltframes would
While I was writing the foregoing paragraph, Mary has sent to inquirewhether I mean to go to Salem tomorrow, intending, if I did, to send aletter by me
 But, alas! I am not going
 The inquiry, however, hasmade me feel a great yearning to be there
 But it is not possible,because I have an engagement at Cambridge on Saturday evening; andeven if it were otherwise, it would be better to wait till the middleof the week, or a little later, when I hope to spend three or fourdays with you
 Oh, what happiness, when we shall be able to lookforward to an illimitable time in each other's society--when a day ortwo of absence will be far more infrequent than the days which wespend together now
 Then a quiet will settle down upon us, apassionate quiet, which is the consummation of happiness
Dearest, I hope you have not found it impracticable to walk, thoughthe atmosphere be so wintry
 Did we walk together in any such coldweather, last winter? I believe we did
 How strange, that such aflower as our affection should have blossomed amid snow and wintrywinds--accompaniments which no poet or novelist, that I know of, hasever introduced into a love-tale
 Nothing like our story was everwritten--or ever will be--for we shall not feel inclined to make thepublic our confidant; but if it could be told, methinks it would besuch as the angels might take delight to hear
 If I mistake not, myDove has expressed some such idea as this, in one of her recentletters
Well-a-day! I have strolled thus far through my letter, without oncemaking mention of naughty Sophie Hawthorne
 Will she pardon theneglect? Present my profound respects to her beloved nose, and saythat I still entreat her to allow my Dove to kiss her cheek
 When shecomplies with this oft-repeated petition, I shall hope that her spiritis beginning to be tamed, and shall then meditate some other and moredifficult trials of it
 Nonsense! Do not believe me, dear littleSophie Hawthorne
 I would not tame you for the whole Universe
But now good bye, dearest wife
 Keep yourself in good heart while I amabsent, and grow round and plump and rosy;--eat a whole chicken everyday;--go to bed at nine o'clock or earlier, and sleep sound tillsunrise
 Come to me in dreams, beloved
 What should I do in this wearyworld, without the idea of you, dearest! Give my love to your fatherand mother, and to Elizabeth
     God bless you, darling
     YOUR OWNEST HUSBAND
Your letter came this forenoon, announcing the advent of the pictures;so I came home as soon as I possibly could--and there was the package!I naturally trembled as I undid it, so eager was I to behold them
Dearissima, there never was anything so lovely and precious in thisworld
 They are perfect
 So soon as the dust and smoke of my fire hadevaporated, I put them on the mantelpiece, and sat a long time beforethem with clasped hands, gazing, and gazing, and gazing, and paintinga fac-simile of them in my heart, in whose most sacred chamber theyshall keep a place forever and ever
 Belovedest, I was not long infinding out the Dove in the Menaggio
 In fact, she was the very firstobject that my eyes rested on, when I uncovered the picture
 She flewstraightway into my heart--and yet she remains just where you placedher
 Dearest, if it had not been for your strict injunctions thatnobody nor anything should touch the pictures, I do believe that mylips would have touched that naughty Sophie Hawthorne, as she standson the bridge
 Do you think the perverse little damsel would havevanished beneath my kiss? What a misfortune would that have been toher poor lover!--to find that he kissed away his mistress
 But, atworst, she would have remained on my lips
 However, I shall refrainfrom all endearments, till you tell me that a kiss may be hazardedwithout fear of her taking it in ill part and absenting herselfwithout leave
Mine ownest, it is a very noble-looking cavalier with whom Sophie isstanding on the bridge
 Are you quite sure that her own husband is thecompanion of her walk? Yet I need not ask--for there is the Dove tobear witness to his identity
 That true and tender bird would neverhave alighted on another hand--never have rested so near anotherbosom
 Yes; it must be my very self; and from henceforth it shall beheld for an absolute and indisputable truth
 It is not my picture, butthe very I; and as my inner self belongs to you, there is no doubtthat you have caused my soul to pervade the figure
 There we are,unchangeable
 Years cannot alter us, nor our relation to each other
Ownest, we will talk about these pictures all our lives and longer; sothere is no need that I should say all that I think and feel aboutthem now; especially as I have yet only begun to understand and feelthem
 I have put them into my bed-room for the present, being afraidto trust them on the mantel-piece; but I cannot help going to feast myeyes upon them, every little while
 I have determined not to hang themup till after I have been to Salem, for fear of the dust and of thefingers of the chamber-maid and other visitants
 Whenever I am away,they will be safely locked up, either in the bureau or in my closet
 Ishall want your express directions as to the height at which theyought to be hung, and the width of the space between them, and otherminutest particulars
 We will discuss these matters, when I come hometo my wife
Belovedest, there are several obstacles to my coming home immediately
At present, two of the Measurers are employed, and another is detainedat his home in Chelsea by the sickness of his family, and Colonel Hallcontinues too unwell to be at the Custom-House; so that I am the onlyone in attendance there; and moreover I have a coal vessel todischarge to-morrow
 But this state of affairs will not continue long
I think I cannot fail to be at liberty by Tuesday or Wednesday atfurthest; and at all events, next week shall not pass without ourmeeting; even if I should have barely time to press you in my arms,and say goodbye
 But the probability is, that I shall come to spend aweek
Dearissima, be patient--Sophie Hawthorne as well as the Dove
My carefullest little wife, I am of opinion that Elizabeth has beenmisinformed as to the increased prevalence of the small-pox
 It couldnot be so generally diffused among the merchants and business-peoplewithout my being aware of it; nor do I hear of its committing suchfearful ravages anywhere
 The folks at the Custom-House know of nosuch matter; nor does George Hillard
 In truth, I had supposed (till Iheard otherwise from you) that all cause for alarm was past
 Trust me,dearest, there is no need of heart-quake on my account
 You have beenin greater danger than your husband
God be with you, blessedest and blessingest
 I did 


     (Remainder of letter missing)Can you reckon the ages that have elapsed since our last embrace? Itquite surpasses my powers of computation
 I only know that, in somelong by-gone time, I had a wife--and that now I am a widowed man,living not in the present, but in the past and future
 My life wouldbe empty indeed, if I could neither remember nor anticipate; but I cando both; and so my heart continues to keep itself full of light andwarmth
 Belovedest, let it be so likewise with you
 You promisedme--did you not?--to be happy during our separation, and really I mustinsist upon holding you to your word even if it should involve amiracle
Dearest, I have hung up the pictures--the Isola over the mantel-piece,and the Menaggio on the opposite wall
 This arrangement pleased mebetter, on the whole, than the other which we contemplated; and Icannot perceive but that the light is equally favorable for them both
You cannot imagine how they glorify our parlor--and what a solace theyare to its widowed inhabitant
 I sit before them with something of thequiet and repose which your own beloved presence is wont to impart tome
 I gaze at them by all sorts of light--daylight, twilight, andcandle-light; and when the lamps are extinguished, and before gettinginto bed, I sit looking at these pictures, by the flickeringfire-light
 They are truly an infinite enjoyment
 I take great care ofthem, and have hitherto hung the curtains before them every morning;and they remain covered till after I have kindled my fire in theafternoon
 But I suppose this precaution need not be taken muchlonger
 I think that this slight veil produces a not unpleasingeffect, especially upon the Isola--a gentle and tender gloom, like thefirst approaches of twilight
 Nevertheless, whenever I remove thecurtains I am always struck with new surprise at the beauty which thengleams forth
 Mine ownest, you are a wonderful little Dove
What beautiful weather this is--beautiful, at least, so far as sun,sky, and atmosphere are concerned; though a poor wingless biped, likemy Dove's husband, is sometimes constrained to wish that he couldraise himself a little above the earth
 How much mud and mire, howmany pools of unclean water, how many slippery footsteps and perchanceheavy tumbles, might be avoided, if we could but tread six inchesabove the crust of this world
 Physically, we cannot do this; ourbodies cannot; but it seems to me that our hearts and minds may keepthemselves above moral mud-puddles, and other discomforts of thesoul's path-way, and so enjoy the sunshine
I have added Coleridge's Poems, a very good edition in three volumes,to our library
 Dearest, dearest, what a joy it is to think of you,whenever I buy a book--to think that we shall read them aloud to oneanother, and that they are to be our mutual and familiar friends forlife
 I intended to have asked you again for that list which youshewed me; but it will do the next time I come
 I mean to go to abook-auction this evening
 When our book-case is filled, mybibliomania will probably cease; for its shelves, I think, would holdabout all the books that I should care to read--all, at least, that Ishould wish to possess as household friends
What a reprehensible husband am I, not to have inquired, in the veryfirst sentence of my letter, whether my belovedest has quiterecovered from the varioloid! But, in truth, it seemed so long sincewe parted, that none but chronic diseases can have subsisted from thattime to this
 I make no doubt, therefore, but that the afflicted armis entirely recovered, and that only a slight scar remains--whichshall be kissed, some time or other
 And how are your eyes, myblessedest? Do not torture them by attempting to write, before theyare quite well
 If you inflict pain on them for such a purpose, yourhusband's eyes will be sensible of it, when he shall read yourletters
 Remember that we have now a common property in each other'seyes
Dearest, I have not seen Colonel Hall since my return hither--he beinggone to Maine
 When he comes back, or shortly thereafter, I will tryto prevail on your neglectful spouse to pay you a short visit
Methinks he is a very cold and loveless sort of person
 I have beenpestering him, ever since I began this letter, to send you some wordof affectionate remembrance; but he utterly refuses to send anything,save a kiss apiece to the Dove's eyes and mouth, and to SophieHawthorne's nose and foot
 Will you have the kindness to see thatthese valuable consignments arrive at their destination? Dearestwife, the letter-writer belies your ownest husband
 He thinks of you,and yearns for you all day long
  Your letter, with its assurance of your present convalescence, and itspromise (to which I shall hold you fast) that you will never be sickany more, caused me much joy



 Dearest, George Hillard came in justas I had written the first sentence; so we will begin on a new score
Your husband has been measuring coal all day, aboard of a black littleBritish schooner, in a dismal dock at the north end of the city
 Mostof the time, he paced the deck to keep himself warm; for the wind(north-east, I believe it was) blew up through the dock, as if it hadbeen the pipe of a pair of bellows
 The vessel lying deep between twowharves, there was no more delightful prospect, on the right hand andon the left, than the posts and timbers, half immersed in the water,and covered with ice, which the rising and falling of successive tideshad left upon them; so that they looked like immense icicles
 Acrossthe water, however, not more than half a mile off, appeared the BunkerHill monument; and what interested me considerably more, achurch-steeple, with the dial of a clock upon it, whereby I wasenabled to measure the march of the weary hours
 Sometimes yourhusband descended into the dirty little cabin of the schooner, andwarmed himself by a red-hot stove, among biscuit-barrels, pots andkettles, sea-chests, and innumerable lumber of all sorts--hisolfactories, meanwhile, being greatly refreshed by the odour of apipe, which the captain or some of his crew were smoking
 But at lastcame the sunset, with delicate clouds, and a purple light upon theislands; and your husband blessed it, because it was the signal of hisrelease; and so he came home to talk with his dearest wife
 And now hebids her farewell, because he is tired and sleepy
 God bless you,belovedest
 Dream happy dreams of me tonight
February 12th--Evening
--All day long again, best wife, has your poorhusband been engaged in a very black business--as black as a coal; andthough his face and hands have undergone a thorough purification, hefeels as if he were not altogether fit to hold communion with hiswhite Dove
 Methinks my profession is somewhat akin to that of achimney-sweeper; but the latter has the advantage over me, because,after climbing up through the darksome flue of the chimney, he emergesinto the midst of the golden air, and sings out his melodies far overthe heads of the whole tribe of weary earth-plodders
 My dearest, mytoil today has been cold and dull enough; nevertheless your husbandwas neither cold nor dull; for he kept his heart warm and his spiritbright with thoughts of his belovedest wife
 I had strong and happyyearnings for you to-day, ownest Dove--happy, even though it was suchan eager longing, which I knew could not then be fulfilled, to claspyou to my bosom
 And now here I am in our parlour, aweary--too tired,almost, to write
Well, dearest, my labors are over for the present
 I cannot, however,come home just at present, three of the Measurers being now absent;but you shall see me very soon
 Naughtiest, why do you say that youhave scarcely seen your husband, this winter? Have there not, to saynothing of shorter visits, been two eternities of more than a weekeach, which were full of blessings for us? My Dove has quite forgottenthese
 Oh, well! If visits of a week long be not worth remembering, Ishall alter my purpose of coming to Salem for another likespace;--otherwise I might possibly have been there, by Saturday night,at furthest
 Dear me, how sleepy I am! I can hardly write, as you willdiscover by the blottings and scratchings
 So good-bye now,darlingest;--and I will finish in the freshness of the morning
February 13th--Past 8 A
M
 Belovedest, how very soon this letter willbe in your hands
 It brings us much closer together, when the writtenwords of one of us can come to the heart of the other, in the verysame day that they flowed from the heart of the writer
 I mean to comehome to our parlour early to-day; so, when you receive this letter,you can imagine me there, sitting in front of the Isola
 I have thismoment interrupted myself to go and look at that precious production
How I wish that naughty Sophie Hawthorne could be induced to turn herface towards me! Nevertheless, the figure is her veritable self, andso would the face be, only that she deems it too beauteous to bethrown away on her husband's gaze
 I have not dared to kiss her yet
Will she abide it?My dearest, do not expect me very fervently till I come
 I am glad youwere so careful of your inestimable eyes as not to write to meyesterday
 Mrs
 Hillard says that Elizabeth made her a call
Good-bye
 I am very well to day, and unspeakably happy in the thoughtthat I have a dearest little wife, who loves me pretty well
 God blessher
  It seems as if I were looking back to a former state of existence,when I think of the precious hours which we have lived together
 Andnow we are in two different worlds--widowed, both of us--both of usdeceased, and each lamenting 


     (Portion of letter missing)Belovedest, almost my first glance, on entering our parlor after myreturn hither, was at the pictures--my very first glance, indeed, assoon as I had lighted the lamps
 They have certainly grown morebeautiful during my absence, and are still becoming more perfect, andperfecter, and perfectest
 I fancied that Sophie Hawthorne, as shestands on the bridge, had slightly turned her head, so as to revealsomewhat more of her face; but if so, she has since turned it backagain
 I was much struck with the Menaggio this morning;--while I wasgazing at it, the sunshine and the shade grew positively real, and Iagreed with you, for the time, in thinking this a more superlativepicture than the other
 But when I came home about an hour ago, Ibestowed my chiefest attention upon the Isola; and now I believe ithas the first place in my affections, though without prejudice to avery fervent love for the other



 Dove, there is little prospect for me, indeed; but forgive me fortelling you so, dearest--no prospect of my returning so soon as nextMonday; but I have good hope to be again at liberty by the close ofthe week
 Do be very good, my Dove--be as good as your nature willpermit, naughty Sophie Hawthorne
 As to myself, I shall take theliberty to torment myself as much as I please
My dearest, I am very well, but exceedingly stupid and heavy; so theremainder of this letter shall be postponed until tomorrow
 Has myDove flown abroad, this cold, bright day? Would that the wind wouldsnatch her up, and waft her to her husband
How was it, dearest? And how do you do this morning? Is the wind east?The sun shone on the chimney-tops round about here, a few minutes ago;and I hoped that there would be a pleasant day for my Dove to takewing, and for Sophie Hawthorne to ride on horseback; but the skyseems to be growing sullen now
 Do you wish to know how your husbandwill spend the day? First of the first--but there rings the bell foreight o'clock; and I must go down to breakfast
After breakfast;--First of the first, your husband will go to thePost-Office, like a dutiful husband as he is, to put in this letterfor his belovedest wife
 Thence he will proceed to the Custom House,and finding that there is no call for him on the wharves, he will sitdown by the Measurers' fire, and read the Morning Post
 Next, at abouthalf past nine o'clock, he will go to the Athenaeum, and turn over theMagazines and Reviews till eleven or twelve, when it will be time toreturn to the Custom-House to see whether there be a letter from DoveHawthorne--and also (though this is of far less importance) to seewhether there be any demand for his services as Measurer
 At oneo'clock, or thereabouts, he will go to dinner--but first, perhaps, hewill promenade the whole length of Washington street, to get himselfan appetite
 After dinner, he will take one more peep at theCustom-House, and it being by this time about two o'clock, and noprospect of business to-day, he will feel at liberty to come home toour own parlor, there to remain till supper-time
 At six o'clock hewill sally forth again, to get some oysters and read the eveningpapers, and returning between seven and eight, he will read andre-read his belovedest's letter--then take up a book--and go to bed atten, with a blessing on his lips for the Dove and Sophie Hawthorne
Thy letter by Elizabeth came, I believe, on Thursday, and the twowhich thou didst entrust to the post reached me not tillyesterday--whereby I enjoyed a double blessing in recompense of theprevious delay
 Nevertheless, it were desirable that the new Salempostmaster be forthwith ejected, for taking upon himself to withholdthe outpourings of thy heart, at their due season
 As for letters ofbusiness, which involve merely the gain or loss of a few thousanddollars, let him be as careless as he pleases; but when thou wouldstutter thyself to thy husband, dearest wife, there is doubtless apeculiar fitness of thy communications to that point and phase of ourexistence, at which they ought to be received
 However, come when theywill, they are sure to make sweetest music with my heart-strings
Blessedest, what an ugly day is this!--and there thou sittest as heavyas thy husband's heart
 And is his heart indeed heavy? Why no--it isnot heaviness--not the heaviness, like a great lump of ice, which Iused to feel when I was alone in the world--but--but--in short,dearest, where thou art not, there it is a sort of death
 A death,however, in which there is still hope and assurance of a joyful lifeto come
 Methinks, if my spirit were not conscious of thy spirit, thisdreary snow-storm would chill me to torpor;--the warmth of my firesidewould be quite powerless to counteract it
 Most absolute little wife,didst thou expressly command me to go to Father Taylor's church thisvery Sabbath?--(Dinner, or luncheon rather, has intervened since thelast sentence)--Now, belovedest, it would not be an auspicious day forme to hear the aforesaid Son of Thunder
 Thou knowest not howdifficult is thy husband to be touched or moved, unless time, andcircumstances, and his own inward state, be in a "concatenationaccordingly
" A dreadful thing would it be, were Father Taylor to failin awakening a sympathy from my spirit to thine
 Darlingest, pray letme stay at home this afternoon
 Some sunshiny Sunday, when I am wideawake, and warm, and genial, I will go and throw myself open to hisblessed influences; but now, there is but one thing (thou beingabsent) which I feel anywise inclined to do--and that is, to go tosleep
 May I go to sleep, belovedest? Think what sweet dreams of theemay visit me--think how I shall escape this snow-storm--think how myheavy mood will change, as the mood of mind almost always does, duringthe interval that withdraws me from the external world
 Yes; thoubidst me sleep
 Sleep thou too, my beloved--let us pass at one and thesame moment into that misty region, and embrace each other there
Well, dearest, I have slept; but Sophie Hawthorne has beennaughty--she would not be dreamed about
 And now that I am awakeagain, here are the same snow-flakes in the air, that were descendingwhen I went to sleep
 Would that there were an art of making sunshine!Knowest thou any such art? Truly thou dost, my blessedest, and hastoften thrown a heavenly sunshine around thy husband's spirit, when allthings else were full of gloom
 What a woe--what a cloud it is, to beaway from thee! How would my Dove like to have her husband continuallywith her, twelve or fourteen months out of the next twenty? Would notthat be real happiness?--in such long communion, should we not feel asif separation were a dream, something that never had been a reality,nor ever could be? Yes; but--for in all earthly happiness there is abut--but, during those twenty months, there would be two intervals ofthree months each, when thy husband would be five hundred milesaway--as far away as Washington
 That would be terrible
 Would notSophie Hawthorne fight against it?--would not the Dove fold her wings,not in the quietude of bliss, but of despair? Do not be frightened,dearest--nor rejoiced either--for the thing will not be
 It might be,if I chose; but on multitudinous accounts, my present situation seemspreferable; and I do pray, that, in one year more, I may find some wayof escaping from this unblest Custom-House; for it is a very grievousthraldom
 I do detest all offices--all, at least, that are held on apolitical tenure
 And I want nothing to do with politicians--they arenot men; they cease to be men, in becoming politicians
 Their heartswither away, and die out of their bodies
 Their consciences are turnedto India-rubber--or to some substance as black as that, and which willstretch as much
 One thing, if no more, I have gained by myCustom-House experience--to know a politician
 It is a knowledge whichno previous thought, or power of sympathy, could have taught me,because the animal, or the machine rather, is not in nature
Oh my darlingest wife, thy husband's soul yearns to embrace thee! Thouart his hope--his joy--he desires nothing but to be with thee, and totoil for thee, and to make thee a happy wife, wherein would consisthis own heavenliest happiness
 Dost thou love him? Yes; he knoweth it
God bless thee, most beloved
And now good night, best, beautifullest, belovedest, blessingest ofwives
 Notwithstanding what I have said of the fleeting andunsatisfying bliss of dreams, still, if thy husband's prayers andwishes can bring thee, or even a shadow of thee, into his sleep, thouor thy image will assuredly be there
 Good night, ownest
 I bid theegood night, although it is still early in the evening; because I mustreserve the rest of the page to greet thee upon in the morning
Here is thy husband, yearning for thee with his whole heart--thou,meanwhile, being fast asleep, and perhaps hovering around him in thydreams
 Very dreary are the first few centuries which elapse after ourseparations, and before it is time to look forward hopefully toanother meeting--these are the "dark ages
" And hast thou been verygood, my beloved? Dost thou dwell in the past and in the future, sothat the gloomy present is quite swallowed up in sunshine? Do so, mineownest, for the sake of thy husband, whose desire it is to make thywhole life as sunny as the scene beyond those high, dark rocks of theMenaggio
Dearest, my thoughts will not flow at all--they are as sluggish as astream of half-cold lava
 Methinks I could sleep an hour ortwo--perhaps thou art calling to me, out of the midst of thy dream, tocome and join thee there
 I will take a book, and lie down awhile,and perhaps resume my pen in the evening
 I will not say good bye; forI am coming to thee now
March 27th,--Before breakfast
--Good morning, most belovedest
 I feltso infinitely stupid, after my afternoon's nap, that I could notpossibly write another word; and it has required a whole night's sleepto restore me the moderate share of intellect and vivacity thatnaturally belongs to me
 Dearest, thou didst not come into my dreams,last night; but, on the contrary, I was engaged in assisting theescape of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette from Paris, during the Frenchrevolution
 And sometimes, by an unaccountable metamorphosis, itseemed as if my mother and sister were in the place of the King andQueen
 I think that fairies rule over our dreams--beings who have notrue reason or true feeling, but mere fantasies instead of thoseendowments
Afternoon
--Blessedest, I do think that it is the doom laid upon me,of murdering so many of the brightest hours of the day at that unblestCustom-House, that makes such havoc with my wits; for here I am again,trying to write worthily to my etherealest, and intellectualest, andfeelingest, and imaginativest wife, yet with a sense as if all thenoblest part of man had been left out of my composition--or haddecayed out of it, since my nature was given to my own keeping
Sweetest Dove, shouldst thou once venture within those precincts, theatmosphere would immediately be fatal to thee--thy wings would ceaseto flutter in a moment--scarcely wouldst thou have time to nestle intothy husband's bosom, ere thy pure spirit would leave what is mortal ofthee there, and flit away to Heaven
 Never comes any bird of Paradiseinto that dismal region
 A salt, or even a coal-ship is ten milliontimes preferable; for there the sky is above me, and the fresh breezearound me, and my thoughts, having hardly anything to do with myoccupation, are as free as air
Nevertheless, belovedest, thou art not to fancy that the aboveparagraph gives thee a correct idea of thy husband's mental andspiritual state; for he is sometimes prone to the sin of exaggeration
It is only once in a while that the image and desire of a better andhappier life makes him feel the iron of his chain; for after all, ahuman spirit may find no insufficiency of food fit for it, even in theCustom-House
 And with such materials as these, I do think, and feel,and learn things that are worth knowing, and which I should not knowunless I had learned them there; so that the present portion of mylife shall not be quite left out of the sum of my real existence
Moreover, I live through my Dove's heart--I live an intellectual lifein Sophie Hawthorne
 Therefore ought those two in one to keepthemselves happy and healthy in mind and feelings, inasmuch as theyenjoy more blessed influences than their husband, and likewise have toprovide happiness and moral health for him
Very dearest, I feel a great deal better now--nay, nothing whatever isthe matter
 What a foolish husband hast thou, misfortunate littleDove, that he will grieve thee with such a long Jeremiad, and afterall find out that there is not the slightest cause for lamentation
But so it must often be, dearest--this trouble hast thou entailed uponthyself, by yielding to become my wife
 Every cloud that broodsbeneath my sky, or that I even fancy is brooding there, must dim thysunshine too
 But here is no real cloud
 It is good for me, on manyaccounts, that my life has had this passage in it
 Thou canst notthink how much more I know than I did a year ago--what a strongersense I have of power to act as a man among men--what worldly wisdom Ihave gained, and wisdom also that is not altogether of this world
 Andwhen I quit this earthy cavern, where I am now buried, nothing willcling to me that ought to be left behind
 Men will not perceive, Itrust, by my look, or the tenor of my thoughts and feelings, that Ihave been a Custom-House officer
Belovedest!--what an awful concussion was that of our two heads
 Itwas as if two worlds had rushed together--as if the Moon (thou art myMoon, gentlest wife) had met in fierce encounter with the rude,rock-promontoried Earth
 Dearest, art thou sure that thy delicatestbrain has suffered no material harm? A maiden's heart, they say, isoften bruised and broken by her lover's cruelty; it was reserved fornaughtiest me to inflict those injuries upon my mistress's head



     (Portion of letter missing)     Thy Thursday's letter came not till Saturday--so long was thy faithfullest husband defrauded of his rights! Thou mayst imagine how hungrywas my heart, when at last it came
 Thy yesterday's letter, for awonder, arrived in its due season, this forenoon; and I could notrefrain from opening it immediately; and then and there, in thatearthy cavern of the Custom-House, and surrounded by all thosebrawling slang-whangers, I held sweet communion with my Dove
 Dearest,I do not believe that any one of those miserable men ever received aletter which uttered a single word of love and faith--which addresseditself in any manner to the soul
 No beautiful and holy woman's spiritcame to visit any of them, save thy husband
 How blest is he! Thoufindest thy way to him in all dismallest and unloveliest places, andtalkest with him there, nor can the loudest babble nor rudest clamorshut out thy gentle voice from his ear
 Truly, he ought not to bemoanhimself any more, as in his last letter, but to esteem himself favoredbeyond all other mortals;--but truly he is a wayward and incalculablepersonage, and will not be prevailed with to know his own happiness
The lovelier thou art, mine ownest, the more doth thy unreasonablehusband discontent himself to be away from thee, though thoucontinually sendest him all of thyself that can be breathed intowritten words
 Oh, I want thee with me forever and ever!--at least Iwould always have the feeling, amid the tumult and unsuitableassociations of the day, that the night would bring me to my home ofpeace and rest--to thee, my fore-ordained wife
 Well--be patient,heart! The time will come
 Meantime, foolishest heart, be thankful forthe much of happiness thou already hast
Dearest, thy husband was very reprehensible, yesterday
 Wilt thouagain forgive him? He went not to hear Father Taylor preach
 In truth,his own private and quiet room did have such a charm for him, afterbeing mixed and tossed together with discordant elements all the week,that he thought his Dove would grant him indulgence for one moreSabbath
 Also, he fancied himself unfit to go out, on account of acold; though, as the disease has quite disappeared to-day, I am afraidhe conjured it up to serve his naughty purpose
 But, indeed, dearest,I feel somewhat afraid to hear this divine Father Taylor, lest mysympathy with thy admiration of him should be colder and feebler thanthou lookest for
 Belovedest wife, our souls are in happiest unison;but we must not disquiet ourselves if every tone be not re-echoed fromone to the other--if every slightest shade be not reflected in thealternate mirror
 Our broad and general sympathy is enough to secureour bliss, without our following it into minute details
 Wilt thoupromise not to be troubled, should thy husband be unable to appreciatethe excellence of Father Taylor? Promise me this; and at someauspicious hour, which I trust will soon arrive, Father Taylor shallhave an opportunity to make music with my soul
 But I forewarn thee,sweetest Dove, that thy husband is a most unmalleable man;--thou artnot to suppose, because his spirit answers to every touch of thine,that therefore every breeze, or even every whirlwind, can upturn himfrom his depths
 Well, dearest, I have said my say, on this matter
What a rain is this, my poor little Dove! Yet as the wind comes fromsome other quarter than the East, I trust that thou hast found itgenial
 Good bye, belovedest, till tomorrow evening
 Meantime, loveme, and dream of me
March 31st
--Evening
--Best Wife, it is scarcely dark yet; but thyhusband has just lighted his lamps, and sits down to talk to thee
Would that he could hear an answer in thine own sweet voice; for hisspirit needs to be cheered by that dearest of all harmonies, after along, listless, weary day
 Just at this moment, it does seem as iflife could not go on without it
 What is to be done?Dearest, if Elizabeth Howe is to be with you on Saturday, it would bequite a calamity to thee and thy household, for me to come at the sametime
 Now will Sophie Hawthorne complain, and the Dove's eyes besuffused, at my supposing that their husband's visit could be acalamity at any time
 Well, at least, we should be obliged to give upmany hours of happiness, and it would not even be certain that I couldhave the privilege of seeing mine own wife in private, at all
Wherefore, considering these things, I have resolved, and do herebymake it a decree of fate, that my present widowhood shall continue oneweek longer
 And my sweetest Dove--yes, and naughtiest SophieHawthorne too--will both concur in the fitness of this resolution, andwill help me to execute it with what of resignation is attainable bymortal man, by writing me a letter full of strength and comfort
 AndI, infinitely dear wife, will write to thee again; so that, though myearthly part will not be with thee on Saturday, yet thou shalt have myheart and soul in a letter
 Will not this be right, and for the best?"Yes, dearest husband," saith my meekest little Dove; and SophieHawthorne cannot gainsay her
Mine unspeakably ownest, dost thou love me a million of times as muchas thou didst a week ago? As for me, my heart grows deeper and widerevery moment, and still thou fillest it in all its depths andboundlessness
 Wilt thou never be satisfied with making me love thee?what use canst thou put so much love as thou continually receivestfrom me? Dost thou hoard it up, as misers do their treasure?     THINE OWN BLESSEDEST HUSBAND
April 1st
 Before breakfast
--Good morning, entirely belovedest
Sophie Hawthorne, I have enclosed something for thee in this letter
If thou findest it not, then tell me what thou art
     Blessedest wife, thy husband has been busy all day, from earlybreakfast-time to late in the afternoon; and old Father Time has goneonward somewhat less heavily, than is his wont when I am imprisonedwithin the walls of the Custom-House
 It has been a brisk, breezy day,as thou knowest--an effervescent atmosphere; and I have enjoyed it inall its freshness, breathing air which had not been breathed inadvance by the hundred thousand pairs of lungs which have common andindivisible property in the atmosphere of this great city
--My breathhad never belonged to anybody but me
 It came fresh from thewilderness of ocean
 My Dove ought to have shared it with me, and sohave made it infinitely sweeter--save her, I would wish to have anatmosphere all to myself
 And, dearest, it was exhilarating to see thevessels, how they bounded over the waves, while a sheet of foam brokeout around them
 I found a good deal of enjoyment, too, in the busyscene around me; for several vessels were disgorging themselves (whatan unseemly figure is this--"disgorge," quotha, as if the vessels weresick at their stomachs) on the wharf; and everybody seemed to beworking with might and main
 It pleased thy husband to think that healso had a part to act in the material and tangible business of thislife, and that a part of all this industry could not have gone onwithout his presence
 Nevertheless, my belovedest, pride not thyselftoo much on thy husband's activity and utilitarianism; he is naturallyan idler, and doubtless will soon be pestering thee with bewailmentsat being compelled to earn his bread by taking some little share inthe toils of mortal man
Most beloved, when I went to the Custom-House, at one o'clock, ColonelHall held up a letter, turning the seal towards me; and he seemed tobe quite as well aware as myself, that the long-legged little fowlimpressed thereon was a messenger from my Dove
 And so, naughtiest,thou art not patient
 Well; it will do no good to scold thee
 I knowSophie Hawthorne of old--yea, of very old time do I know her; orrather, of very old eternity
 There was an image of such a being, deepwithin my soul, before we met in this dim world; and thereforenothing that she does, or says, or thinks, or feels, ever surprisesme
 Her naughtiness is as familiar to me as if it were my own
 Butdearest, do be patient; because thou seest that the busy days arecoming again; and how is thy husband to bear his toil lightsomely, ifhe knows that thou art impatient and disquieted
 By and bye, as soonas God will open a way to us, we will help one another bear theburthen of the day, whatever it may be
My little Dove, the excellent Colonel Hall, conceiving, I suppose,that our correspondence must necessarily involve a great expenditureof paper, has imparted to thy husband a quire or two of superfinegilt-edged, which he brought from Congress
 The sheet on which I amnow writing is a specimen; and he charged me to give thee a portion ofit, which I promised to do--but whether I shall convey it to thee inthe mass, or sheet by sheet, after spoiling it with my uncouthscribble, is yet undetermined
 Which wouldst thou prefer? Likewisethree sticks of sealing-[wax] did the good Colonel bestow; butunfortunately it is all red
 Yet I think it proper enough that agentleman should seal all his letters with red sealing-wax; though itis sweet and graceful in my Dove to use fancy-colored
 Dearest, thepaper thou shalt have, every sheet of it, sooner or later; and onlythat it is so burthensome to thy foolish husband to carry anything inhis hand, I would bring it to thee
 Meantime, till I hit upon someother method, I will send it sheet by sheet
     How long it is, belovedest, since I have written thee a letter fromthis darksome region
 Never did I write thee a word from hence thatwas worth reading, nor shall I now; but perhaps thou wouldst get noword at all, these two or three days, unless I write it here
 Thisevening, dearest, I am to have a visitor--the illustrious Colonel Hallhimself; and I have even promised him a bed on my parlor floor--sothat, as thou seest, the duties of hospitality will keep me fromcommunion with the best little wife in the world
Hearts never do understand the mystery of separation--that is thebusiness of the head
 My sweetest, dearest, purest, holiest, noblest,faithfullest wife, dost thou know what a loving husband thou hast?Dost thou love him most immensely?--beyond conception, and dost thoufeel, as he does, that every new throb of love is worth all otherhappiness in the world?Dearest, my soul drank thy letter this forenoon, and has beenconscious of it ever since, in the midst of business and noise and allsorts of wearisome babble
 How dreamlike it makes all my externallife, this continual thought and deepest, inmostest musing upon thee!I live only within myself; for thou art always there
 Thou makest me adisembodied spirit; and with the eve of a spirit, I look on allworldly things--and this it [is] that separates thy husband from thosewho seem to be his fellows--therefore is he "among them, but not ofthem
" Thou art transfused into his heart, and spread all round aboutit; and it is only once in a while that he himself is even imperfectlyconscious of what a miracle has been wrought upon him
Well, dearest, were ever such words as these written in a Custom-Housebefore? Oh, and what a mighty heave my heart has given, this verymoment! Thou art most assuredly thinking of me now, wife of my inmostbosom
 Never did I know what love was before--I did not even know itwhen I began this letter
 Ah, but I ought not to say that; it wouldmake me sad to believe that I had not always loved thee
 Farewell,now, dearest
 Be quiet, my Dove; lest my heart be made to flutter bythe fluttering of thy wings
April 7th
 6 P
M
 My tenderest Dove, hast thou lived through the polarwinter of to-day; for it does appear to me to have been the mostuncomfortable day that ever was inflicted on poor mortals
 Thy husbandhas had to face it in all its terrors; and the cold has penetratedthrough his cloak, through his beaver-cloth coat and vest, and wasneutralised nowhere but in the region round about his heart--and thatit did not chill him even there, he owes to thee
 I know not whether Ishould not have jumped overboard in despair today, if I had notsustained my spirit by the thought of thee, most beloved wife; for,besides the bleak, unkindly air, I have been plagued by two sets ofcoal-shovellers at the same time, and have had to keep two separatetallies simultaneously
 But, dearest, I was conscious that all thiswas merely a vision and a phantasy, and that, in reality, I was nothalf-frozen by the bitter blast, nor plagued to death by those grimycoal-heavers, but that I was basking quietly in the sunshine ofeternity, with mine own Dove
 Any sort of bodily and earthly tormentmay serve to make us sensible that we have a soul that is not withinthe jurisdiction of such shadowy demons--it separates the immortalwithin us from the mortal
 But the wind has blown my brain into suchconfusion that I cannot philosophise now
Blessingest wife, what a habit I have contracted of late, of tellingthee all my grievances and annoyances, as if such trifles were worthtelling--or as if, supposing them to be so, they would be the mostagreeable gossip in the world to thee
 Thou makest me behave like achild, naughtiest
 Why dost thou not frown at my nonsensicalcomplaints, and utterly refuse thy sympathy? But I speak to thee ofthe miseries of a cold day, and blustering wind, and intractablecoal-shovellers, with just the same certainty that thou wilt listenlovingly and sympathisingly, as if I were speaking of the momentousand permanent concerns of life
Dearest, 


 (portion of letter missing)I do not think that I can come on Friday--there is hardly anylikelihood of it; for one of the Measurers is indisposed, which throwsadditional work on the efficient members of our honorable body
 Butthere is no expressing how I do yearn for thee! The strength of thefeeling seems to make my words cold and tame
 Dearest, this is but apoor epistle, yet is written in very great love and worship ofthee--so, for the writer's sake, thou wilt receive it into thy heartof hearts
 God keep thee--and me also for thy sake
     THINE OWNEST
          Belovedest--since writing this word, I have made a considerable pause;for, dearest, my mind has no activity to-day
 I would fain sit still,and let thoughts, feelings, and images of thee, pass before me andthrough me, without my putting them into words, or taking any othertrouble about the matter
 It must be that thou dost not especially andexceedingly need a letter from me; else I should feel an impulse andnecessity to write
 I do wish, most beloved wife, that there were someother method of communing with thee at a distance; for really this isnot a natural one to thy husband
 In truth, I never use words, eitherwith the tongue or pen, when I can possibly express myself in anyother way;--and how much, dearest, may be expressed without theutterance of a word! Is there not a volume in many of ourglances?--even in a pressure of the hand? And when I write to thee,I do but painfully endeavor to shadow into words what has already beenexpressed in those realities
 In heaven, I am very sure, there will beno occasion for words;--our minds will enter into each other, andsilently possess themselves of their natural riches
 Even in thisworld, I think, such a process is not altogether impossible--weourselves have experienced it--but words come like an earthy wallbetwixt us
 Then our minds are compelled to stand apart, and makesignals of our meaning, instead of rushing into one another, andholding converse in an infinite and eternal language
 Oh, dearest,have [not] the moments of our oneness been those in which we were mostsilent? It is our instinct to be silent then, because words could notadequately express the perfect concord of our hearts, and thereforewould infringe upon it
 Well, ownest, good bye till tomorrow, whenperhaps thy husband will feel a necessity to use even such a wretchedmedium as words, to tell thee how he loves thee
 No words can tell itnow
April 15th
 Afternoon
--Most dear wife, never was thy husband gladderto receive a letter from thee than to-day
 And so thou didst perceivethat I was rather out of spirits on Monday
 Foolish and faithlesshusband that I was, I supposed that thou wouldst not take any noticeof it; but the simple fact was, that I did not feel quite so well asusual; and said nothing about it to thee, because I knew thou wouldstdesire me to put off my departure, which (for such a trifle) I felt itnot right to do--and likewise, because my Dove would have beennaughty, and so perhaps have made herself ten times as ill as herhusband
 Dearest, I am quite well now--only very hungry; for I havethought fit to eat very little for two days past; and I thinkstarvation is a remedy for almost all physical evils
 You will loveColonel Hall, when I tell you that he has not let me do a 


 (fewwords missing) 


 and even to-day he has sent me home to my room,although I assured him that I was perfectly able to work
 Now,dearest, it thou givest thyself any trouble and torment about thispast indisposition of mine, I shall never dare to tell thee about myfuture incommodities; but if I were sure thou wouldst estimate them atno more than they are worth, thou shouldst know them all, even to theslightest prick of my finger
 It is my impulse to complain to thee inall griefs, great and small; and I will not check that impulse, ifthou wilt sympathise reasonably, as well as most lovingly
 And now,ownest wife, believe that thy husband is well;--better, I fear, thanthou, who art tired to death, and hast even had the headache
Naughtiest, dost thou think that all the busts in the world, and allthe medallions and other forms of sculpture, would be worth creatingat the expence of such weariness and headaches to thee
 I would ratherthat thy art should be annihilated, than that thou shouldst always paythis price for its exercise
 But perhaps, when thou hast my bosom torepose upon, thou wilt no longer feel such overwhelming weariness
 Iam given thee to repose upon, that so my most tender and sensitivestlittle Dove may be able to do great works
And dearest, I do by no means undervalue thy works, though I cannotestimate all thou hast ever done at the price of a single throb ofanguish to thy belovedest head
 But thou has achieved mighty things
Thou hast called up a face which was hidden in the grave--hastre-created it, after it was resolved to dust--and so hast snatchedfrom Death his victory
 I wonder at thee, my beloved
 Thou art amiracle thyself, and workest miracles
 I would not have believed itpossible to do what thou hast done--to restore the lineaments of thedead so perfectly that even she who loved him so well can requirenothing more;--and this too, when thou hadst hardly known his livingface
 Thou couldst not have done it, unless God had helped thee
 Thissurely was inspiration, and of the holiest kind, and for one of theholiest purposes
Dearest, I shall long to see thee exceedingly next Saturday; buthaving been absent from duty for two or three days past it will not beright for me to ask any more time so soon
 Dost thou think it would?How naughty was thy husband to waste the first page of this letter indeclaiming against the blessed art of writing! I do not see how Icould live without it;--thy letters are my heart's food; andoftentimes my heart absolutely insists upon pouring itself out onpaper, for thy perusal
 In truth, if the heart would do all the work,I should probably write to thee the whole time of my absence; but thouknowest that the co-operation of the hand and head are indispensable;and they, not being able to comprehend the infinite necessity of theheart's finding utterance, are sometimes sluggish
April 17th
--Before breakfast
--Ownest, I am perfectly well thismorning
 Dost thou love me? Dearest, expect not another letter tillTuesday
 Is thy weariness quite gone?     THINE OWNEST, OWNEST HUSBAND
          , April 19th, 1840
--Forenoon
Dearest, there came no letter from thee yesterday; and I have been alittle disquieted with fears that thou art not well and art naughtyenough to conceal it from thy husband
 But this is a misdemeanor ofwhich my Dove ought not to be lightly suspected
 Or perhaps, ownestwife, thou didst imagine that I might mean to surprise thee by avisit, last evening, and therefore, instead of writing, didst hope tocommune with me in living words
 Best belovedest, if I could havecome, I would have given thee notice beforehand; for I love notsurprises, even joyful ones--or at least, I would rather that joyshould come quietly, and as a matter of course, and warning us of itsapproach by casting a placid gleam before it
 Mine own wife, art thouvery well? Thy husband is so, only love-sick--a disease only to becured by the pressure of a certain heart to his own heart
Belovedest, what a beautiful day was yesterday
 Wert thou abroad inthe sky and air? Thy husband's spirit did rebel against being confinedin his darksome dungeon, at the Custom-House; it seemed a sin--amurder of the joyful young day--a quenching of the sunshine
Nevertheless, there he was kept a prisoner,--till it was too late tofling himself on a gentle wind and be blown away into the country
 Iforesee, dearest, that thou wilt, now that the pleasant days of Mayand June are coming, be tormented quite beyond thine infinitepatience, with my groans and lamentations at being compelled to loseso much of life's scanty summertime
 But thou must enjoy for both ofus
 Thou must listen to the notes of the birds, because the rumblingof wheels will be always in my ears--thou must fill thyself with thefragrance of wild flowers, because I must breathe in the dust of thecity--thy spirit must enjoy a double share of freedom, because thyhusband is doomed to be a captive
 It is thine office now, most sweetwife, to make all the additions that may be made to our common stockof enjoyment
 By and bye, there shall not be so heavy burthen imposedupon thee
 When I shall be again free, I will enjoy all things withthe fresh simplicity of a child of five years old; thou shalt findthine husband grown young again, made over all anew--he will goforth and stand in a summer shower, and all the worldly dust that hascollected on him shall be washed away at once
 Then, dearest, wheneverthou art aweary, thou shalt lie down upon his heart as upon a bank offresh flowers
Nearly 6--P
M
 Thy husband went out to walk, dearest, about an hourago, and found it very pleasant, though there was a somewhat coolwind
 I went round and across the common, and stood on the highestpoint of it, whence I could see miles and miles into the country
Blessed be God for this green tract, and the view which it affords;whereby we poor citizens may be put in mind, sometimes, that all God'searth is not composed of brick blocks of houses, and of stone orwooden pavements
 Blessed be God for the sky too; though the smoke ofthe city may somewhat change its aspect--but still it is better thanif each street were covered over with a roof
 There were a good manypeople walking on the mall, mechanicks apparently and shopkeepers'clerks, with their wives and sweethearts; and boys were rolling on thegrass--and thy husband would have liked to lie down and roll too
Wouldst thou not have been ashamed of him? And, Oh, dearest, thoushouldst have been there, to help me to enjoy the green grass, and thefar-off hills and fields--to teach me how to enjoy them, for when Iview Nature without thee, I feel that I lack a sense
 When we aretogether, thy whole mind and fancy, as well as thy whole heart, ismine; so that all thy impressions from earth, sea, and sky, are addedto all mine
 How necessary hast thou made thyself to thy husband, mylittle Dove! When he is weary and out of spirits, his heart yearnethfor thee; and when he is among pleasant scenes, he requireth thee somuch the more
My dearest, why didst thou not write to me, yesterday? It were alwaysadvisable, methinks, to arrange matters so that a letter may be senton each Saturday, when I am not coming home; because Sunday leaves mefree to muse upon thee, and to imagine the state and circumstances inwhich thou art--and the present Sunday I have been troubled withfancies that thou art ill of body or ill at ease in mind
 Do not thouhave any such foolish fancies about me, mine ownest
 Oh, how we find,at every moment of our lives, that we ought always to be together!Then there would be none of these needless heartquakes; but now howcan they be avoided, when we mutually feel that one-half our being iswandering away by itself, without the guidance and guard of the otherhalf! Well; it will not be always so
 Doubtless, God has planned howto make us happy; but thy husband, being of a rebellious anddistrustful nature, cannot help wishing sometimes that our Fatherwould let him into His plans
I do trust, my dearest, that thou hast been enjoying this bright dayfor both of us; for thy husband has spent it in his dungeon--and theonly ray of light that broke upon him, was when he opened thy letter
Belovedest, I have folded it to my heart, and ever and anon it sends athrill through me; for thou hast steeped it with thy love--it seems asif thy head were leaning against my breast
 I long to get home, that Imay read it again and again; for in this uncongenial region, I can buthalf comprehend it--at least, I feel that there is a richness andsweetness in it, too sacred to be enjoyed, save in privacy
 Dearestwife, thy poor husband is sometimes driven to wish that thou and hecould mount upon a cloud (as we used to fancy in those heavenly walksof ours) and be borne quite out of sight and hearing of all theworld;--then, at last, our souls might melt into each other; but now,all the people in the world seem to come between us
 How happy wereAdam and Eve! There was no third person to come between them, and allthe infinity around them only served to press their hearts closertogether
 We love [one] another as well as they: but there is nosilent and lovely garden of Eden for us
 Mine own, wilt thou sail awaywith me to discover some summer island?--dost thou not think that Godhas reserved one for us, ever since the beginning of the world? Ah,foolish husband that I am, to raise a question of it, when we havefound such an Eden, such an island sacred to us two, whenever, whetherin Mrs
 Quincy's boudoir, or anywhere else, we have been clasped inone another's arms! That holy circle shuts out all the world--then weare the Adam and Eve of a virgin earth
 Now good-bye dearest; forvoices are babbling around me, and I should not wonder if thou wertto hear the echo of them, while thou readest this letter
April 22d--6 o'clock P
M
 To-day, dearest, I have been measuring salt,on Long-Wharf; and though considerably weary, I feel better satisfiedthan if I had been murdering the blessed day at the Custom-House
 Mineown wife, how very good wast thou, to take me with thee on that sweetwalk, last Monday! And how kind-hearted was that sensible old stump!Thou enquirest whether I ever heard a stump speak before
 No, indeed;but "stump-speeches" (as thou mayst learn in the newspapers) are verycommon in the western country
 Belovedest, I have met with an immensemisfortune
 Dost thou sympathise from the bottom of thy heart? Wouldstthou take it upon thyself, if possible? Yea; I know thou wouldst, evenwithout asking the nature of it; and truth to tell, I could be selfishenough to wish that thou mightest share it with me
 Now art thou allin a fever of anxiety! I feel the fluttering of thy foolish littleheart
 Shall I tell thee? No
--Yes; I will
 I have received aninvitation to a party at General McNeil's, next Friday evening
 Whywill not people let your poor persecuted husband alone? What possiblegood can it do for me to thrust my coal-begrimed visage andsalt-befrosted locks into good society? What claim have I to bethere--a humble Measurer, a subordinate Custom-House officer, as I am!I cannot go
 I will not go
 I intend to pass that evening with mywife--that is to say, in musings and dreams of her, and moreover, itwas an exceeding breach of etiquette, that this belovedest wife wasnot included in the invitation
My duties began at sunrise, after a somewhat scanty night's rest;for George Hillard and his brother, from London, came to see me, whenI was preparing to go [to] bed; and I was kept up pretty late
 But Icame home at about four o'clock, and straightway went to bed! What asinful way was that of misusing this summer afternoon! I trust, mostdear wife, that the better half of my being has drawn from the sweetday all the honey that it contained
 I feel as if it were not so muchmatter, now, whether my days pass pleasantly or irksomely, since thoucanst be living a golden life for both of us
 Sometime or other, wewill contribute each an equal share of enjoyment
Dearest, thou knowest not how I have yearned for thee
 And now thereis but one day more of widowhood! Sophie Hawthorne must not expect meany more on Fridays, till the busy season is over
 If I can alwayscome on the appointed Saturday, it will be a great mercy of Heaven;but I trust in Heaven's goodness, and the instrumentality of ColonelHall
 Now God bless thee, ownest wife
 God bless us
     I did not reach home last night till candle-light, and then I wasbeyond expression weary and spiritless; and I could as soon haveclimbed into Heaven without a ladder, as to come to see thee at Mrs
Park's
 So, instead of dressing to pay a visit, I undressed and wentto bed; but yet I doubt whether I ought not to have gone, for I wasrestless and wakeful a great part of the night; and it seemed as if Ihad scarcely fallen asleep, when I awoke with a start, and saw thegray dawn creeping over the roofs of the houses
 So then it wasnecessary for thy poor husband to leave his pillow, without enjoyingthat half-dreaming interval which I so delight to devote to thee
However the fresh morning air made a new creature of me; and all day Ihave felt tolerably lively and cheerful--as much so as is anywiseconsistent with this intolerable position of near distance, ordistant nearness, in which we now find ourselves
 Truly Providencedoes not seem to have smiled on this visit of thine, my dearest
 Thedispensation is somewhat hard to bear
 There is a weight and a gnawingat my heart; but, belovedest, do let thy heart be cheerful, for thyhusband's sake
Very reviving to me was thy letter, mine ownest
 Colonel Hall broughtit at noon to the eating-house where we had agreed to dine together;and I forthwith opened it and read it while my beefsteak was broiling
It refreshed me much more than my dinner--which is a great deal for ahungry man to say
 Dearest, I am in admirable health; it is not thenature of my present mode of life to make me sick; and my nightlyweariness does not betoken anything of that kind
 Each day, it istrue, exhausts all the life and animation that there is in me; buteach night restores as much as will be required for the expenditure ofthe next day
 I think this week has been about as tough as any that Iever experienced
 I feel the burthen of such constant occupation themore sensibly, from having had so many idle intervals of late
Oh, dearest, do not thou tire thyself to death
 Whenever thou feelestweary, then oughtest thou to glide away from all the world; and go tosleep with the thought of thy husband in thy heart
 Why do notpeople know better what is requisite for a Dove, than thus to keep herwings fluttering all day long, never allowing her a moment to foldthem in peace and quietness? I am anxious for thee, mine ownest wife
When I have the sole charge of thee, these things shall not be
Belovedest, didst thou not bless this shower? It caused thy husband'slabors to cease for the day, though it confined him in the cabin ofthe salt-ship till it was over; but when the drops came few and farbetween, I journeyed hither to our parlor, and began this scribble
Really I did not think my ideas would be alert enough to write half somuch; but I have scrawled one line after another; and now I feel muchrevived, and soothed and cheered in mind
 I shall sleep the morequietly, sweetest wife, for having had this talk with thee--thou wiltbless my sleep
 I wish that thou couldst receive this letter to-night,because I am sure thou needest it
Let me know, mine ownest, what time thou intendest to go to Salem; andif it be possible, I will come to the Depot to see thee
 But do notexpect me too fervently, because there are many chances that it willnot be in my power
 What a time this has been for my Dove and me!Never, since we were married, have the fates been so perverse
 Andnow farewell, my dearest, dearest wife, on whom I repose, in whom I amblest--whom I love with all the heart that is in me, and will lovemore and more forever, as I grow more worthy to love thee
 Be happy,dearest; for my happiness must come through thee
God bless thee, and let me feel his blessing through thy heart
Where in the world art thou?--or hast thou flown away to Paradise,naughtiest Dove, without bidding thy husband farewell? I know notwhereabout this letter will find thee; but I throw it upon the windsin the confidence that some breeze of Heaven will bear it to thee; forI suppose heart never spoke to heart, without being heard, and sooneror later finding a response
 Perhaps some hearts that speak to otherhearts here on earth may find no response till they have passed farinto Eternity; but our hearts catch each other's whispers even here
Happy we! But, belovedest, how is it that thou hast sent me no tokenof thy existence, since we parted on the Hoopers' doorstep, when thoudidst press my hand without a word? It seems an age since then
 Thousaidst, on Sunday, that thou shouldst probably return to Salem to-day;but surely thou hast not gone
 I feel lonely and not cheerful--myspirit knows not whereabout to seek thee, and so it shivers as ifthere were no Thou at all--as if my Dove had been only a dream and avision, and now had vanished into unreality and nothingness
But tomorrow I shall surely hear from thee: and even should it beotherwise, I shall yet know, with everlasting faith, that my Dove'sheart has been trying to make me sensible of its embraces all thistime
 My dearest, was not that a sweet time--that Sabbath afternoonand eve? But why didst thou look up in my face, as we walked, and askwhy I was so grave? If I was grave I know no cause for it, beloved
Lights and shadows are continually flitting across my inward sky, andI know neither whence they come nor whither they go; nor do I inquiretoo closely into them
 It is dangerous to look too minutely at suchphenomena
 It is apt to create a substance, where at first there was amere shadow
 If at any time, dearest wife, there should seem--thoughto me there never does--but if there should ever seem to be anexpression unintelligible from one of our souls to another, we willnot strive to interpret it into earthly language, but wait for thesoul to make itself understood; and were we to wait a thousand years,we need deem it no more time than we can spare
 I speak only inreference to such dim and intangible matters as that which suggestedthis passage of my letter
 It is not that I have any love for mystery;but because I abhor it--and because I have felt, a thousand times,that words may be a thick and darksome veil of mystery between thesoul and the truth which it seeks
 Wretched were we, indeed, if we hadno better means of communicating ourselves, no fairer garb in which toarray our essential selves, than these poor rags and tatters of Babel
Yet words are not without their use, even for purposes ofexplanation,--but merely for explaining outward acts, and all sorts ofexternal things, leaving the soul's life and action to explain itselfin its own way
My belovedest, what a misty disquisition have I scribbled! I would notread it over for sixpence
 Think not that I supposed it necessary tosermonize thee so; but the sermon created itself from sentence tosentence; and being written, thou knowest that it belongs to thee, andI have no right to keep it back
 Dearest, I was up very early thismorning, and have had a good deal to do, especially this afternoon
Let me plead this excuse for my dulness and mistiness
 I suspect that,hereafter, my little Dove will know how to estimate the difficulty ofpouring one's self out in a soul-written letter, amid thedistractions of business and society--she herself having experiencedthese checks upon her outpourings
Now good bye, mine ownest wife
 God bless us both--or may God blesseither of us, and that one will bless the other
 Dost thou sleep wellnow-a-nights, belovedest? Of whom dost thou dream? Thy husband's longdays and short nights hardly leave him time to dream
     THINE OWNEST
Dearest, just as I was folding this letter, came thy note
 Do thou beat the Depot as soon as possible after eleven; and I will move Heavenand earth to meet thee there
 Perhaps a little before eleven
Rejoice with thy husband, for he is free from a load of coal, whichhas been pressing upon his shoulders throughout all this hot weather
I am convinced that Christian's burthen consisted of coal; and nowonder he felt so much relieved when it fell off and rolled into thesepulchre
 His load, however, at the utmost, could not have been morethan a few bushels; whereas mine was exactly one hundred andthirty-five chaldrons and seven tubs



 Oh, my dearest, I feel thestroke upon mine own head
 Except through thee, I can never feel anytorment of that nature; for all these burning suns have blazed upon myhead, unprotected except by a black hat, and yet I have felt no moreinconvenience than if I had been sitting in the pleasant gloom of adewy grot
 Belovedest, be a great deal more careful of thyself
Remember always that thou art not thine own, but that Providence hasentrusted to thy keeping a most delicate physical frame, which belongswholly to me, and which therefore thou must keep with infinitely morecare than thou wouldst the most precious jewel
 And yet, I would nothave thee anxious and watchful like an invalid; but thou shouldstconsider that thou wert created to dwell nowhere but in the clime ofParadise, and wast only placed upon this earth, because thy husband ishere and cannot do without thee--and that east-winds and fierce sunsare evil unknown in thy native region, and therefore thy frame was notso constructed as to resist them; wherefore thine own wise precautionsmust be thy safeguard
 Blessedest, I kiss thy brow,--at least, I kissthe air thrice; and if none of the three kisses reach thee, then threevery precious things will have gone forth from my heart in vain
 Butif any of thy headache and bewilderment have remained hitherto, andnow thou feelest somewhat like a breath of Heaven on thy brow, we willtake it for granted that my kisses have found thee out
 Good bye now,dearest wife; for I am weary and stupid; and as I need not be at theCustom-House before eight or nine o'clock tomorrow, thou shalt havethe rest of the letter freshly written in the morning
Now it will be lucky for thee if thou gettest the last page of thisletter entirely full
 Dearest, thy last letter had the fragrance of abank of violets--yea, all sorts of sweet smelling flowers and perfumedshrubs
 I can lie down and repose upon it, as upon a bed of roses
 Itrejoices me to think that my whole being is not enveloped withcoal-dust, but that its better half is breathing the breath offlowers
 Oh, do be very happy, mine ownest wife, and fill thyself withall gentle pleasures that lie within thy reach; because at presentthou hast a double duty to perform in this respect; since, so far asmy enjoyments depend on external things, I can contribute nothing tothe common stock of happiness
 And yet dearest, nothing that I everenjoyed before can come into the remotest comparison with my continualenjoyment of thy love--with the deep, satisfied repose which thatconsciousness brings to me; a repose subsisting, and ever to subsist,in the midst of all anxieties, troubles and agitations
Belovedest, I sometimes wish that thou couldst be with [me] on boardmy salt-vessels and colliers; because there are many things of whichthou mightst make such pretty descriptions; and in future years, whenthy husband is again busy at the loom of fiction, he would weave inthese little pictures
 My fancy is rendered so torpid by my ungenialway of life, that I cannot sketch off the scenes and portraits thatinterest me; and I am forced to trust them to my memory, with the hopeof recalling them at some more favorable period
 For three or fourdays past, I have been observing a little Mediterranean boy, fromMalaga, not more than ten or eleven years old, but who is already acitizen of the world, and seems to be just as gay and contented on thedeck of a Yankee coal-vessel, as he could be while playing beside hismother's door
 It is really touching to see how free and happy heis--how the little fellow takes this whole wide world for his home,and all mankind for his family
 He talks Spanish--at least, that ishis native tongue; but he is also very intelligible in English, andperhaps he likewise has smatterings of the speech of other countries,whither the winds may have wafted this little sea-bird
 He is aCatholic; and yesterday, being Friday, he caught some fish and friedthem for his dinner, in sweet oil; and really they looked so delicatethat I almost wished he would invite me to partake
 Every once in awhile, he undresses himself and leaps overboard, plunging down beneaththe waves, as if the sea were as native to him as the earth; then heruns up the rigging of the vessel, as if he meant to fly away throughthe air
 Do thou remember this little boy, dearest, and tell me ofhim one of these days; and perhaps I may make something more beautifulof him than thou wouldst think from these rough and imperfect touches
Belovedest, is thy head quite well? Art thou very beautiful now? Dostthou love me infinitely?Thy Friday's letter came in due season to the Custom-House; butColonel Hall could not find time to bring it to the remote region ofthe earth, where I was then an exile; so that it awaited me till thenext morning
 At noon, came thy next letter, at an interval of severalhours from the receipt of the former--a space quite long enough to beinterposed between thy missives
 And yesterday arrived thy letter ofthe Sabbath--and all three are very precious to thy husband; and theoftener they come the more he needs them
 Now I must go down tobreakfast
 Dost thou not wonder at finding me scribbling between sevenand eight o'clock in the morning? I do believe, naughtiest, that thouhast been praying for the non-arrival of salt and coal--notconsidering that, if thy petitions are heard, the poor Measurers willnot earn a sixpence
Belovedest, I know not what counsel to give thee about calling on mysisters; and therefore must leave the matter to thine own exquisitesense of what is right and delicate
 We will talk it over at an earlyopportunity
 I think I can partly understand why they appear cooltowards thee; but it is for nothing in thyself personally, nor for anyunkindness towards my Dove, whom everybody must feel to be theloveablest being in the world
 But there are some untowardcircumstances
 Nevertheless, I have faith that all will be well, andthat they will receive Sophie Hawthorne and the Dove into their heartof hearts; so let us wait patiently on Providence, as we always have,and see what time will bring forth
 And, my dearest, whenever thoufeelest disquieted about things of this sort--if ever that be thecase--do thou speak freely to thy husband; for these are matters inwhich words may be of use, because they concern the relations betweenourselves and others
 Now, good bye, belovedest, till night
 Iperceive that the sun is shining dimly; but I fear that there is stillan east wind to keep my Dove in her dove-cote
Towards night--Ownest wife, the day has been spent without muchpleasure or profit--a part of the time at the Custom-House, waitingthere for the chance of work,--partly at the Athenaeum, and partlyat a bookstore, looking for something suitable for our library
 Amongother recent purchases, I have bought a very good edition of Milton(his poetry) in two octavo volumes; and I saw a huge new London volumeof his prose works, but it seemed to me that there was but a smallportion of it that thou and I should ever care about reading--so Ileft it on the shelf
 Dearest, I have bought some lithographic printsat auction, which I mean to send thee, that thou mayst show them tothy husband, the next afternoon that thou permittest him to spend withthee
 Thou art not to expect anything very splendid; for I did notenter the auction-room till a large part of the collection was sold;so that my choice was limited
 Perhaps there are one or two notaltogether unworthy to be put on the walls of our sanctuary; but thisI leave to thy finer judgment
 I would thou couldst peep into my roomand see thine own pictures, from which I have removed the black veils;and there is no telling how much brighter and cheerfuller the parlorlooks now, whenever I enter it
Belovedest, I love thee very especially much today
 But then thatnaughty Sophie Hawthorne--it would be out of the question to treat herwith tenderness
 Nothing shall she get from me, at my next visit,save a kiss upon her nose; and I should not wonder it she were toreturn the favor with a buffet upon my ear
 Mine own Dove, how unhappyart thou to be linked with such a mate!--to be bound up in the samevolume with her!--and me unhappy, too, to be forced to keep such aturbulent little rebel in my inmost heart! Dost thou not think shemight be persuaded to withdraw herself, quietly, and take up herresidence somewhere else? Oh, what an idea! It makes my heart closeits valves and embrace her the more closely
Well, dearest, it is breakfast time, and thy husband hath an appetite
What dost thou eat for breakfast?--but I know well enough that thounever eatest anything but bread and milk and chickens
 Dost thou lovepigeons in a pie? I am fonder of Dove than anything else--it is myheart's food and sole sustenance
 God bless us
Thou hast strayed quite out of the sphere of my imagination, and Iknow not how to represent thy whereabout, any more than if thou hadstgone on pilgrimage beyond the sea, or to the moon
 Dost thou stilllove me, in all thy wanderings? Are there any east-winds there? Truly,now that thou hast escaped beyond its jurisdiction, I could wish thatthe east wind would blow every day, from ten o'clock till five; forthere is great refreshment in it for us poor mortals that toil beneaththe sun
 Dearest, thou must not think too unkindly even of theeast-wind
 It is not, perhaps, a wind to be loved, even in itsbenignest moods; but there are seasons when I delight to feel itsbreath upon my cheek, though it be never advisable to throw open mybosom and take it into my heart, as I would its gentle sisters of theSouth and West
 To-day, if I had been on the wharves, the slightchill of an east wind would have been a blessing, like the chill ofdeath to a world-weary man
 But, dearest, thou wilt rejoice to hearthat this has been one of the very idlest days that I ever spent in
 Oh, hadst thou been here! In the morning, soon afterbreakfast, I went to the Athenaeum Gallery; and during the hour or twothat I stayed, not a single visitor came in
 Some people were puttingup paintings in one division of the room; but we might have had theother all to ourselves--thy husband had it all to himself--or rather,he did not have it, nor possess it in fulness and reality, becausethou wast not there
 I cannot see pictures without thee; so thou mustnot expect me to criticise this exhibition
 There are two picturesthere by our friend (thy friend--and is it not the same thing?) SarahClark--scenes in Kentucky
 Doubtless I shall find them very admirable,when we have looked at them together
 The gallery of sculpture I shallnot visit, unless I can be there with thee
From the picture gallery I went to the reading-room of the Athenaeum,and there read the magazines till nearly twelve--thence to theCustom-House, and soon afterwards to dinner with Colonel Hall--thenback to the Custom-House, but only for a little while
 There wasnothing in the world to do, and so, at two o'clock, I came home andlay down on the bed, with the Faery Queen in my hand, and my Dove inmy heart
 Soon a pleasant slumber came over me; it was not a deep,sound sleep, but a slumbrous withdrawing of myself from the externalworld
 Whether thou camest to me in a dream, I cannot tell; but thoudidst peep at me through all the interstices of sleep
 After I awoke,I did not take up the Faery Queen again, but lay thinking of thee, andat last bestirred myself and got up to write this letter
 Mybelovedest wife, does it not make thee happy to think that thy husbandhas escaped, for one whole summer day, from his burthen of salt andcoal, and has been almost as idle as ever his idle nature coulddesire?--and this, too, on one of the longest days of all the year!Oh, could I have spent it in some shady nook, with mine own wife! Nowgood-bye, blessedest
 So indolent is thy husband, that he intends nowto relieve himself even from the sweet toil of shaping his thoughts ofthee into written words; moreover, there is no present need of it,because I am not to be at the Custom-House very early, and can finishthis letter tomorrow morning
 Good-bye, dearest, and keep a quietheart

--Belovedest, art thou not going to be veryhappy to-day? I hope so, and believe so; and, dearest, if thou findestthyself comfortable at Concord--and if the Emersonians love thee andadmire thee as they ought--do not thou too stubbornly refuse to stay aweek longer than the term first assigned
(Remainder of letter missing)     , June 22d, (Monday) ½ past 4 [1840]Ownest, Colonel Hall put thy letter into my hand at our eating-house,so that its reception was timed very like that of mine to thee; butthy husband cared not for ceremony, nor for the presence of fiftypeople, but straightway broke the "long-legged little fowl" asunderand began to read
 Belovedest, what a letter! Never was so much beautypoured out of any heart before; and to read it over and over is likebathing my brow in a fresh fountain, and drinking draughts that renewthe life within me
 Nature is kind and motherly to thee, and takeththee into her inmost heart and cherisheth thee there, because thoulookest on her with holy and loving eyes
 My dearest, how canst thousay that I have ever written anything beautiful, being thyself sopotent to reproduce whatever is loveliest? If I did not know that thoulovest me, I should even be ashamed before thee
 Sweetest wife, itgladdens me likewise that thou meetest with such sympathy there, andthat thy friends have faith that thy husband is worthy of thee,because they see that thy wise heart could not have gone astray
Worthy of thee I am not; but thou wilt make me so; for there will betime, or eternity enough, for thy blessed influence to work upon me
Would that we could build our cottage this very now, this very summer,amid the scenes which thou describest
 My heart thirsts and languishesto be there, away from the hot sun and the coal-dust and the steamingdocks, and the thick-pated, stubborn, contentious men, with whom Ibrawl from morning till night, and all the weary toil which quiteengrosses me, and yet occupies only a part of my being which I did notknow existed before I became a Measurer
 I do think that I should sinkdown quite disheartened and inanimate if thou wert not happy, andgathering from earth and sky enjoyment for both of us; but this makesme feel that my real, innermost soul is apart from all these unlovelycircumstances,--and that it has not ceased to exist, as I mightsometimes suspect, but is nourished and kept alive through thee
Belovedest, if thou findest it good to be there, why wilt thou notstay even a little longer than this week? Thou knowest not whatcomfort I have in thinking of thee and those beautiful scenes; wherethe east wind cometh not, and amid those sympathizing hearts, whichperhaps thou wilt not find elsewhere--at least not everywhere
 I feelas if thou hadst found a haven of peace and rest, where I can trustthee without disquiet, and feel that thou art safe
 It thou art welland happy, if thy cheek is becoming rosier, if thy step is light andjoyous there, and if thy heart makes pleasant music, then is it notbetter for thee to stay a little longer? And if better for thee, it isso for thy husband likewise
 Now, ownest wife, I do not press thee tostay, but leave it all to thy wisdom, and if thou feelest that it isnow time to come home, most gladly will he welcome thee
Dearest, I meant to have written to thee yesterday afternoon, so thatthou shouldst have received the letter today, but Mrs
 Hillard pressedher husband and myself to take a walk into the country, because hishealth needed such an excursion
 So, after taking a nap, we set forthover the western avenue--a dreary, treeless, fierce-sunshiny, irksomeroad; but after journeying three or four or five miles, we came tosome of the loveliest rural scenery--yes, the very loveliest--thatever I saw in my life
 The first part of our road was like the life oftoil and weariness that I am now leading; the latter part was likethe life that we will lead hereafter
 Would that I had thy pen, and Iwould give thee pictures of beauty to match thine own; but I shouldonly mar my remembrance of them by the attempt
 Not a beautiful scenedid I behold but I imaged thee in the midst of it--thou wast with mein all the walk, and when I sighed it was for thee, and when I smiledit was for thee, and when I trusted in future happiness, it was forthee; and if I did not doubt and fear, it was altogether because ofthee
 What else than happiness can God intend for thee?--and if thyhappiness, then mine also
 On our return, we stopped at Braman'sbaths, and plunged in, and washed away all stains of earth, and becamenew creatures
 Dearest, I sympathize with thee in thy love of thebath, and conveniences for it must not be forgotten in our domesticarrangements
 Yet I am not entirely satisfied with any more contractedbath than the illimitable ocean; and to plunge into it is the nextthing to soaring into the sky
This morning I rose early to finish measuring a load of coal, whichbeing accomplished in the forenoon, and there being little prospect ofanything more to do, Colonel Hall, who perceived that thy husband'senergies were somewhat exhausted by the heat, and by much brawlingwith the coal-people, did send me home immediately after dinner
 Sothen I took a nap, with a volume of Spenser in my hand, and awaking atfour, I re-re-reperused thy last letter, and sat down to pour myselfout to thee, and in so doing, dearest wife, I have had great comfort
And now the afternoon is beautiful in its decline; but my feet aresomewhat afflicted with yesterday's excursion; so that I am in doubtwhether to go out again, although I should like a bath
Belovedest, I must not forget to thank Mr
 Emerson for his invitationto Concord; but really it will not be in my power to accept it
 Dothou say this in the way it ought to be said, and let him know what abusiness-machine thy husband is
 Now, good-bye
 Art thou very happy? Itrust so, dearest
 Thou hast our whole treasure of happiness in thykeeping
 Keep it safe, ownest wife, and add to it continually
 Godbless thee
Doubtless thou didst expect a letter from me yesterday; but my dayshave been so busy, and my evenings so invaded with visitants, that Ihave not had a moment's time to talk with thee
 Scarcely, till thismorning, have I been able to read thy letter quietly
 Night beforelast, came Mr
 Jones Very; and thou knowest that he is somewhatunconscionable as to the length of his calls
 Yesterday I came homeearly; and had the fates been propitious, thou shouldst have had along letter; but in the afternoon came Mr
 Hillard's London brother,and wasted my precious hours with a dull talk of nothing; and in theevening I was sorely tried with Mr
 Conolly, and a Cambridgelaw-student, who came to do homage to thy husband's literary renown
So my sweetest wife was put aside for these idle people
 I do wish theblockheads, and all other blockheads in this world, could comprehendhow inestimable are the quiet hours of a busy man--especially whenthat man has no native impulse to keep him busy, but is continuallyforced to battle with his own nature, which yearns for seclusion (thesolitude of a united two, my belovedest) and freedom to think, anddream, and feel
Well, dearest, thy husband is in perfect health this morning, and goodspirits; and much doth he rejoice that thou art so soon to be nearhim
 No tongue can tell--no pen can write what I feel
 Belovedest, donot thou make thyself sick in the bustle of removing; for I think thatthere is nothing more trying, even to a robust frame and ruggedspirit, than the disturbance of such an occasion
 Now, good-bye; for Imust hurry to the Custom-House to see Colonel Hall, who is going outof town for two days, and will probably leave the administration ofour department in my hands
God bless thee, belovedest;--and perhaps thou wilt receive anotherI have almost forgotten how to write letters--not having put pen topaper for that purpose (or any other, indeed) since my last to thee;but I cannot help writing thee a few lines, now when I had hoped to belistening to thy sweetest voice
 Art thou much changed in thisintervening time? Is thy hair grown gray? Art thou an old woman?Truly, it does appear very, very long to thy husband--an incomputableperiod
 Belovedest, I had been out this forenoon; and when I returned,there was thy letter, lying on the threshold of my chamber-door
 I hada presage of calamity, as soon as I saw it
 Had I known of this visitof thine aunt, I would have taken the opportunity to go to Salem, andso we would have had next Sunday to ourselves
 Does thine aunt saythat thou lookest in magnificent health?--and that thou art verybeautiful? If she has not yet said so thou shouldst ask her opinion onthat point
Belovedest, even if thine aunt Curtis should stay a week, do notthou incommode thy mother and sisters by trying to arrange a meeting
It is very painful to me to disturb and derange anybody in the world
Thou dost not say whether thou art very well to-day--and whether thouart light of heart
 I beseech thee never to write me even the shortestnote, without giving me a glimpse of thyself in the very moment ofwriting;--and yet, I leave it all to thee, and withdraw this lastpetition
 Thou knowest best what to write; for thou art an inspiredlittle penwoman
Thy husband is to measure salt at the end of Long Wharf tomorrow, andthe next day, and probably the next, and the next
 It is as desirablea place and employment as a Measurer can expect; so let thy visions ofme be rather pleasurable than otherwise
 I am in particularly goodhealth; but my heart hungers for thee--nevertheless, I mean to becheerful and content
 Do thou be so likewise, little Dove--and naughtySophie Hawthorne too
 Now, good-bye
 This is a very empty letter--atleast, it would be so, if it had not an infinite love in it
 God blessthee
I had a presentiment of a letter from thee this morning; and so wasnot at all surprised when I saw thy father in the long, low, darksomeroom where thy husband was in durance
 But I had not the leastanticipation of the intelligence which thou didst send me; and it isthe harder to be borne, because--(do not be naughty, ownest Dove)--Ihave an indispensable engagement at Cambridge tomorrow afternoon andevening; whereby our meeting must be delayed yet another day
 Dearest,do set me a lofty example of patience
 Be very good and very quiet,and enjoy thy Aunt Curtis's society to the utmost, and press her tostay with thee till Wednesday at six o'clock
 But not an hour longer!Thou must absolutely eject [her] with thine own tender little hands,if she propose to tarry that night also
Belovedest, I went to the Hurley Burley last evening; and consideringthat it was the first time I had been there without thee since wewere married, I enjoyed it very well
 We had a good deal of talk; butI missed thy gentle voice, which is surely the sweetest sound that wasever heard anywhere save in Paradise
 Thy husband talked somewhat morethan is his wont, but said nothing that is at all worth repeating; andI think he might as well have dispensed with saying anything
 He showshis wisdom and policy much more in his general silence than in hisoccasional loquacity
 Dearest, if I had not so high a respect for thyjudgment, I should pronounce thy husband but a tolerable person, atbest; but as thou hast been impelled to give thy precious self to sucha man, there must be more in him than ordinary eyes can perceive
 MissBurley proposed to me to write an address of some kind for theBunker-Hill fair; but I manifested no readiness to comply--neither doI feel any
 Has my Dove contributed anything?I went home in the midst of that beautiful rain, and sat up two hourswith Elizabeth and Louisa
This has not been a toilsome day, my wife
 Indeed, I have had nothingto do; nor is it certain that I shall be employed tomorrow morning
Quite unexpected is this lull amid the tempest of business
 I left theCustom-House at about four o'clock, and went to the bath, where Ispent half an hour very deliciously
 Dearest, we must have all sortsof bathing conveniences in our establishment
 Thou art a water-spirit,like Undine
 And thy spirit is to mine a pure fountain, in which Ibathe my brow and heart; and immediately all the fever of the worlddeparts
 Thou art--but I cannot quite get hold of the idea that Imeant to express; and as I want to leave a part of the page tilltomorrow morning, I will stop here
 God bless thee
 I think I shalldream of thee to night, for I never loved thee so much
Thy father, apparently, did not see fit to carry thy letter to theCustom-House; and yet I think my intuition informed me that a letterwas written; for I looked into the Desk very eagerly, although ColonelHall neither pointed with his finger nor glanced with his eye, as ishis custom when anything very precious is in store
 It reached me herein mine own tabernacle, about half an hour since, while I sat restingmyself from the toils of the day, thinking of thee, my Dove
Thou didst make me happier, last evening, than I ever hoped to be,save in Heaven--and still that same happiness is around me and withinme
 I am the happier for everything thou dost and sayest--thou canstnot possibly act so that I will not love thee better and be thehappier for that very individual action
Dearest, it was necessary that I should speak to thee to-night; butthou must not look for such a golden letter as thou didst write thismorning; for thy husband is tolerably weary, and has very few thoughtsin his mind, though much love in his heart
 I cannot do without thyvoice--thou knowest not what a sweet influence it has upon me, evenapart from the honied wisdom which thou utterest
 It thou shouldsttalk in an unknown tongue, I should listen with infinite satisfaction,and be much edified in spirit at least, if not in intellect
 When thouspeakest to me, there is mingled with those earthly words, which aremortal inventions, a far diviner language, which thy soul utters andmy soul understands
Ownest Dove, I did not choose to go to Malden this evening, to hearthe political lecture which I told thee of; for, indeed, after toilingall day, it is rather too hard to be bothered with such nonsense atnight
 I have no desire to go anywhither, after sunset, save to seemine own wife; and as to lectures, I love none but "curtainlectures";--for such I suppose thine may be termed, although ourbeloved so far hath no curtains
 Dearest, when we live together, thouwilt find me a most tediously stay-at-home husband
 Thou wilt becompelled to rebuke and objurgate me, in order to gain the privilegeof spending one or two evenings in a month by a solitary fireside
Sweetest wife, I must bid thee farewell now, exhorting thee to be ashappy as the angels; for thou art as good and holy as they, and havemore merit in thy goodness than they have; because the angels havealways dwelt in sinless heaven; whereas thy pilgrimage has been onearth, where many sin and go astray
 I am ashamed of this letter;there is nothing in it worthy of being offered to my Dove; but yet Ishall send it; for a letter to one's beloved wife ought not to be keptback for any dimness of thought or feebleness of expression, any morethan a prayer should be stifled in the soul, because the tongue of mancannot breathe it eloquently to the Deity
 Love has its ownomniscience; and what Love speaks to Love is comprehended in the sameway that prayers are
Ownest, dost thou not long very earnestly to see thy husband?Well--thou shalt see him on Monday night; and this very night he willcome into thy dreams, if thou wilt admit him there
Here sits thy husband in his old accustomed chamber, where he used tosit in years gone by, before his soul became acquainted with thine
Here I have written many tales--many that have been burned toashes--many that doubtless deserved the same fate
 This deserves to becalled a haunted chamber, for thousands upon thousands of visions haveappeared to me in it; and some few of them have become visible to theworld
 If ever I should have a biographer, he ought to make greatmention of this chamber in my memoirs, because so much of my lonelyyouth was wasted here, and here my mind and character were formed; andhere I have been glad and hopeful, and here I have been despondent;and here I sat a long, long time, waiting patiently for the world toknow me, and sometimes wondering why it did not know me sooner, orwhether it would ever know me at all--at least, till I were in mygrave
 And sometimes (for I had no wife then to keep my heart warm) itseemed as if I were already in the grave, with only life enough to bechilled and benumbed
 But oftener I was happy--at least, as happy as Ithen knew how to be, or was aware of the possibility of being
 By andbye, the world found me out in my lonely chamber, and called meforth--not, indeed, with a loud roar of acclamation, but rather with astill, small voice; and forth I went, but found nothing in the worldthat I thought preferable to my old solitude, till at length a certainDove was revealed to me, in the shadow of a seclusion as deep as myown had been
 And I drew nearer and nearer to the Dove, and opened mybosom to her, and she flitted into it, and closed her wings there--andthere she nestles now and forever, keeping my heart warm, and renewingmy life with her own
 So now I begin to understand why I wasimprisoned so many years in this lonely chamber, and why I could neverbreak through the viewless bolts and bars; for if I had sooner made myescape into the world, I should have grown hard and rough, and beencovered with earthly dust, and my heart would have become callous byrude encounters with the multitude; so that I should have been allunfit to shelter a heavenly Dove in my arms
 But living in solitudetill the fulness of time was come, I still kept the dew of my youthand the freshness of my heart, and had these to offer to my Dove
Well, dearest, I had no notion what I was going to write, when Ibegan, and indeed I doubted whether I should write anything at all;for after such communion as that of our last blissful evening, itseems as if a sheet of paper could only be a veil betwixt us
 Ownest,in the times that I have been speaking of, I used to think that Icould imagine all passions, all feelings, all states of the heart andmind; but how little did I know what it is to be mingled withanother's being! Thou only hast taught me that I have a heart--thouonly hast thrown a light deep downward, and upward, into my soul
 Thouonly hast revealed me to myself; for without thy aid, my bestknowledge of myself would have been merely to know my own shadow--towatch it flickering on the wall, and mistake its fantasies for my ownreal actions
 Indeed, we are but shadows--we are not endowed with reallife, and all that seems most real about us is but the thinnestsubstance of a dream--till the heart is touched
 That touch createsus--then we begin to be--thereby we are beings of reality, andinheritors of eternity
 Now, dearest, dost thou comprehend what thouhast done for me? And is it not a somewhat fearful thought, that a fewslight circumstances might have prevented us from meeting, and then Ishould have returned to my solitude, sooner or later (probably now,when I have thrown down my burthen of coal and salt) and never should[have] been created at all! But this is an idle speculation
 If thewhole world had stood between us, we must have met--if we had beenborn in different ages, we could not have been sundered
Belovedest, how dost thou do? If I mistake not, it was a southern rainyesterday, and, next to the sunshine of Paradise, that seems to bethy element
Never was a wife so yearned for as thou art
 I wonder how I could haveresolved to be absent from thee so long--it is far too long a time tobe wasted in a suspension of life
 My heart is sometimes faint forwant of thee--and sometimes it is violent and tumultuous for the samecause
 How is it with thine, mine ownest? Dost thou not feel, whenthou goest to bed, that the day is utterly incomplete?--that it hasbeen an unsatisfactory dream, wherein the soul groped wearily forsomething that it could not obtain? Thus it is with thy husband
What a history wilt thou have to tell me, when I come back! We shallbe a week in getting through it
 Poor little Dove, I pity thee now:for I apprehend that, by this time, thou hast got thy husband'sdullest of all books to read
 And how many pages canst thou read,without falling asleep? Well is it for thee, that thou hast adoptedthe practice of extending thyself on the sopha, while at thy studies;for now I need be under no apprehension of thy sinking out of a chair
I would, for thy sake, that thou couldst find anything laudable inthis awful little volume; because thou wouldst like to tell thyhusband that he has done well
Oh, this weather!--how dismal it is
 A sullen sky above, and mud and"slosh" below! Thy husband needs thy sunshine, thou cheerfullestlittle wife; for he is quite pervaded and imbued with the sullennessof all nature
 Thou knowest that his disposition is never the mostgracious in the world; but now he is absolutely intolerable
 The daysshould be all sunshine when he is away from thee; because, if therewere twenty suns in the unclouded sky, yet his most essential sunshinewould be wanting
 Well, there is one good in absence; it makes merealise more adequately how much I love thee--and what an infiniteportion of me thou art
 It makes me happy even to yearn and sigh forthee as I do; because I love to be conscious of our deep, indissolubleunion--and of the impossibility of living without thee
 There issomething good in me, else thou couldst not have become one with me,thou holy wife
 I shall be happy, because God has made my happinessnecessary to that of one whom He loves
 Thus is it that I reason withmyself; and therefore my soul rejoices to feel the intermingling ofour beings, even when it is felt in this longing desire for thee
Dearest, amongst my other reasons for wishing to be in , wouldstthou believe that I am eager to behold thy alabaster vase--and thelittle flower-vase, and thy two precious pictures? Even so it is
Thou, who art the loadstone of my soul, hast magnetised them,therefore they attract me
I met Frederic Howes last evening, and promised to go there to-night;although he seemed to think that Miss Burley will be in 
Perhaps thou wilt see her there
 I wonder if she will not come andsettle with us in Mr
 Ripley's Utopia
 And this reminds me to askwhether thou hast drawn those caricatures--especially the one of thyhusband, staggering, and puffing, and toiling onward to the gate ofthe farm, burthened with the unsaleable remnant of Grandfather'sChair
 Dear me, what a ponderous, leaden load it will be!Dearest, I am utterly ashamed of my handwriting
 I wonder how thoucanst anywise tolerate what is so ungraceful, being thyself all grace
But I think I seldom write so shamefully as in this epistle
 It is atoil and torment to write upon this sheet of paper; for it seems to begreasy, and feels very unpleasantly to the pen
 Moreover the penitself is very culpable
 Yet thou wouldst make the fairest, delicateststrokes upon the same paper, with the same pen
 Thou art beautifulthroughout, even to the minutest thing
Infinitely dearest, I went to the post office yesterday, after dinner,and inquiring for a letter, thy "visible silence" was put into myhands
 Canst thou remotely imagine how glad I was? Hast thou also beengladdened by an uncouth scribbling, which thy husband dispatched tothee on Monday? Oh, belovedest, no words can tell how thirsty myspirit is for thine! Surely I was very reprehensible to conceive theidea of spending a whole week and more away from thee
 Why didst thounot scold me? and go with me wherever I went? Without thee, I have butthe semblance of life
 All the world hereabouts seems dull anddrowsy--a vision, but without any spirituality--and I, likewise anunspiritual shadow, struggle vainly to catch hold of something real
Thou art my reality; and nothing else is real for me, unless thou giveit that golden quality by thy touch
Dearest, how camest thou by the headache? Thou shouldst have dreamedof thy husband's breast, instead of that Arabian execution; and thenthou wouldst have awaked with a very delicious thrill in thy heart,and no pain in thy head
 And what wilt thou do to-day, persecutedlittle Dove, when thy abiding-place will be a Babel of talkers? Wouldthat Miss Margaret Fuller might lose her tongue!--or my Dove her ears,and so be left wholly to her husband's golden silence! Dearest wife, Itruly think that we could dispense with audible speech, and yet neverfeel the want of an interpreter between our spirits
 We have soaredinto a region where we talk together in a language that can have noearthly echo
 Articulate words are a harsh clamor and dissonance
 Whenman arrives at his highest perfection, he will again be dumb!--for Isuppose he was dumb at the Creation, and must perform an entire circlein order to return to that blessed state
 Cousin Christopher, by thyaccount, seems to be of the same opinion, and is gradually learning totalk without the use of his voice
Jany
 15th
 Friday
--Oh, belovedest, what a weary week is this! Neverdid I experience the like
 I went to bed last night, positively dismaland comfortless
 Wilt thou know thy husband's face, when we meetagain? Art thou much changed by the flight of years, my poor littlewife? Is thy hair turned gray? Dost thou wear a day-cap, as well asa night cap? How long since didst thou begin to use spectacles?Perhaps thou wilt not like to have me see thee, now that Time has donehis worst to mar thy beauty; but fear thou not, sweetest Dove, forwhat I have loved and admired in thee is eternal
 I shall look throughthe envious mist of age, and discern thy immortal grace as perfectlyas in the light of Paradise
 As for thy husband, he is grown quitebald and gray, and has very deep wrinkles across his brow, andcrowsfeet and furrows all over his face
 His eyesight fails him, sothat he can only read the largest print in the broadest day-light; butit is a singular circumstance, that he makes out to decypher the pygmycharacters of thy epistles, even by the faintest twilight
 The secretis, that they are characters of light to him, so that he coulddoubtless read them in midnight darkness
 Art thou not glad,belovedest, that thou wast ordained to be a heavenly light to thyhusband, amid the dreary twilight of age?Grandfather is very anxious to know what has become of his chair, andthe Famous Old People who sat in it
 I tell him that it will probablyarrive in the course of to-day; and that he need not be so impatient;for the public will be very well content to wait, even were it tillDoomsday
 He acquiesces, but scolds, nevertheless
I saw thy cousin Mary Tappan yesterday, and felt the better for it,because she is connected with thee in my mind
 Dearest, I love theevery much!!!! Art thou not astonished? I wish to ask thee a question,but will reserve it for the extreme end of this letter
I trust that thou art quite well, belovedest
 That headache took avery unfair advantage, in attacking thee while thou wast away from thyhusband
 It is his province to guard thee both from head-ache andheart-ache; and thou performest the same blessed office for him, sofar as regards the heart-ache--as to the head-ache, he knows it not,probably because his head is like a block of wood
Now good-bye, dearest, sweetest, loveliest, holiest, truest,suitablest little wife
 I worship thee
 Thou art my type of womanlyperfection
 Thou keepest my heart pure, and elevatest me above theworld
 Thou enablest me to interpret the riddle of life, and fillestme with faith in the unseen and better land, because thou leadest methither continually
 God bless thee forever
Dost thou love me?Very dearest, what a dismal sky is this that hangs over us! Thyhusband doth but half live to-day--his soul lies asleep, or rathertorpid
 As for thee, thou hast been prating at a great rate, and hasspoken many wonderful truths in to-day's conversation
Belovedest, thou wast very sweet and lovely in our walk yesterdaymorning; and it gladdens me much that Providence brought us together
Dost thou not think that there is always some especial blessinggranted us, when we are to be divided for any length of time? Thourememberest what a blissful evening came down from Heaven to us,before our last separation; insomuch that our hearts glowed with itsinfluence, all through the ensuing week
 And yesterday there came aheavenly morning, and thou camest with it like a rosy vision, whichstill lingers with me, and will not quite fade away, till it be timefor it to brighten into reality
 Surely, thou art beloved of Heaven,and all these blessings are vouchsafed for thy sake; for I do notremember that such things used to happen to me, while I was a solitarysinner
 Thou bringest a rich portion to thy husband, dearest--even theblessing of thy Heavenly Father
Whenever I return to Salem, I feel how dark my life would be, withoutthe light that thou shedst upon it--how cold, without the warmth ofthy love
 Sitting in this chamber, where my youth wasted itself invain, I can partly estimate the change that has been wrought
 It seemsas it the better part of me had been born, since then
 I had walkedthose many years in darkness, and might so have walked through life,with only a dreamy notion that there was any light in the universe, ifthou hadst not kissed mine eye-lids, and given me to see
 Thou,belovedest, hast always been positively happy
 Not so thy husband--hehas only been not miserable
 Then which of us has gained the most? Thyhusband, assuredly
When a beam of heavenly sunshine incorporates itself with a darkcloud, is not the cloud benefitted more than the sunshine? What ahappy image is this!--my soul is the cloud, and thine thesunshine--but a gentler, sweeter sunshine than ever melted into anyother cloud
Dearest wife, nothing at all has happened to me, since I left thee
 Itpuzzles me to conceive how thou meetest with so many more events thanthy husband
 Thou wilt have a volume to tell me, when we meet, andwilt pour thy beloved voice into mine ears, in a stream of two hours'long
 At length thou wilt pause, and say--"But what has thy lifebeen?"--and then will thy stupid husband look back upon what he callshis life, for three or four days past, and behold a blank! Thou livestten times as much [as] he; because thy spirit takes so much more noteof things
I met our friend Mr
 Howes in the street, yesterday, and held a briefconfabulation
 He did not inquire how my wife's health is
 Was notthis a sin against etiquette? Dearest, thy husband's stupid book seemsto meet more approbation here, than the former volume did--thoughthat was greeted more favorably than it deserved
 There is asuperfluity of newspaper puffs here, and a deficiency in , wherethey are much needed
 I ought to love Salem better than I do; for thepeople have always had a pretty generous faith in me, ever since theyknew me at all
 I fear I must be undeserving of their praise, else Ishould never get it
 What an ungrateful blockhead thy husband is!
