"Let the bird of loudest lay
On the sole Arabian tree
Herald sad and trumpet be,
To whose sound chaste wings obey.

But thou shrieking harbinger,
Foul precurrer of the fiend,
Augur of the fever's end,
To this troop come thou not near.

From this session interdict
Every fowl of tyrant wing,
Save the eagle, feather'd king;
Keep the obsequy so strict.

Let the priest in surplice white,
That defunctive music can,
Be the death-divining swan,
Lest the requiem lack his right.

And thou treble-dated crow,
That thy sable gender mak'st
With the breath thou giv'st and tak'st,
'Mongst our mourners shalt thou go.

Here the anthem doth commence:
Love and constancy is dead;
Phoenix and the Turtle fled
In a mutual flame from hence.

So they lov'd, as love in twain
Had the essence but in one;
Two distincts, division none:
Number there in love was slain.

Hearts remote, yet not asunder;
Distance and no space was seen
'Twixt this Turtle and his queen:
But in them it were a wonder.

So between them love did shine
That the Turtle saw his right
Flaming in the Phoenix' sight:
Either was the other's mine.

Property was thus appalled
That the self was not the same;
Single nature's double name
Neither two nor one was called.

Reason, in itself confounded,
Saw division grow together,
To themselves yet either neither,
Simple were so well compounded;

That it cried, ""How true a twain
Seemeth this concordant one!
Love has reason, reason none,
If what parts can so remain.""

Whereupon it made this threne
To the Phoenix and the Dove,
Co-supremes and stars of love,
As chorus to their tragic scene:

                 threnos

Beauty, truth, and rarity,
Grace in all simplicity,
Here enclos'd, in cinders lie.

Death is now the Phoenix' nest,
And the Turtle's loyal breast
To eternity doth rest,

Leaving no posterity:
'Twas not their infirmity,
It was married chastity.

Truth may seem but cannot be;
Beauty brag but 'tis not she;
Truth and beauty buried be.

To this urn let those repair
That are either true or fair;
For these dead birds sigh a prayer."
"Sir Charles into my chamber coming in,
When I was writing of my Fairy Queen;
I praysaid hewhen Queen Mab you do see
Present my service to her Majesty:
And tell her I have heard Fame's loud report
Both of her beauty and her stately court.
When I Queen Mab within my fancy viewed,
My thoughts bowed low, fearing I should be rude;
Kissing her garment thin which fancy made,
I knelt upon a thought, like one that prayed;
And then, in whispers soft, I did present
His humble service which in mirth was sent;
Thus by imagination I have been
In Fairy court and seen the Fairy Queen."
"Our vice runs beyond all that old men saw,
And far authentically above our laws,
And scorning virtues safe and golden mean,
Sits uncontrolled upon the high extreme.
Circes, thy monsters painted out the hue,
Of feigned filthiness, but ours is true.
Our vice puts down all proverbs and all themes,
Our vice excels all fables and all dreams."
"Lo I the man, whose Muse whilome did maske,
As time her taught in lowly Shepheards weeds,
Am now enforst a far unfitter taske,
For trumpets sterne to chaunge mine Oaten reeds,
And sing of Knights and Ladies gentle deeds;
Whose prayses having slept in silence long,
Me, all too meane, the sacred Muse areeds
To blazon broad emongst her learned throng:
Fierce warres and faithful loves shall moralize my song.
Helpe then, O holy Virgin chiefe of nine,
Thy weaker Novice to performe thy will,
Lay forth out of thine everlasting scryne
The antique rolles, which there lye hidden still,
Of Faerie knights and fairest Tanaquill,
Whom that most noble Briton Prince so long
Sought through the world, and suffered so much ill,
That I must rue his undeserved wrong:
O helpe thou my weake wit, and sharpen my dull tong.
And thou most dreaded impe of highest Jove,
Faire Venus sonne, that with thy cruell dart
At that good knight so cunningly didst rove,
That glorious fire it kindled in his hart,
Lay now thy deadly Heben bow apart,
And with thy mother milde come to mine ayde:
Come both, and with you bring triumphant Mart,
In loves and gentle jollities arrayd,
After his murdrous spoiles and bloudy rage allayd.
And with them eke, O Goddesse heavenly bright,
Mirrour of grace and Majestie divine,
Great Lady of the greatest Isle, whose light
Like Phoebus lampe throughout the world doth shine,
Shed thy faire beames into my feeble eyne,
And raise my thoughts too humble and too vile,
To thinke of that true glorious type of thine,
The argument of mine afflicted stile:
The which to heare, vouchsafe, O dearest dred a-while.

i
A Gentle Knight was pricking on the plaine,
Y cladd in mightie armes and silver shielde,
Wherein old dints of deepe wounds did remaine,
The cruell markes of many a bloudy fielde;
Yet armes till that time did he never wield:
His angry steede did chide his foming bitt,
As much disdayning to the curbe to yield:
Full jolly knight he seemd, and faire did sitt,
As one for knightly giusts and fierce encounters fitt.

ii
But on his brest a bloudie Crosse he bore,
The deare remembrance of his dying Lord,
For whose sweete sake that glorious badge he wore,
And dead as living ever him ador'd:
Upon his shield the like was also scor'd,
For soveraine hope, which in his helpe he had:
Right faithfull true he was in deede and word,
But of his cheere did seeme too solemne sad;
Yet nothing did he dread, but ever was ydrad.

iii
Upon a great adventure he was bond,
That greatest Gloriana to him gave,
That greatest Glorious Queene of Faerie lond,
To winne him worship, and her grace to have,
Which of all earthly things he most did crave;
And ever as he rode, his hart did earne
To prove his puissance in battell brave
Upon his foe, and his new force to learne;
Upon his foe, a Dragon horrible and stearne.

iv
A lovely Ladie rode him faire beside,
Upon a lowly Asse more white then snow,
Yet she much whiter, but the same did hide
Under a vele, that wimpled was full low,
And over all a blacke stole she did throw,
As one that inly mournd: so was she sad,
And heavie sat upon her palfrey slow;
Seemed in heart some hidden care she had,
And by her in a line a milke white lambe she lad.

v
So pure an innocent, as that same lambe,
She was in life and every vertuous lore,
And by descent from Royall lynage came
Of ancient Kings and Queenes, that had of yore
Their scepters stretcht from East to Westerne shore,
And all the world in their subjection held;
Till that infernall feend with foule uprore
Forwasted all their land, and them expeld:
Whom to avenge, she had this Knight from far compeld.

vi
Behind her farre away a Dwarfe did lag,
That lasie seemd in being ever last,
Or wearied with bearing of her bag
Of needments at his backe. Thus as they past,
The day with cloudes was suddeine overcast,
And angry Jove an hideous storme of raine
Did poure into his Lemans lap so fast,
That every wight to shrowd it did constrain,
And this faire couple eke to shroud themselves were fain.

vii
Enforst to seeke some covert nigh at hand,
A shadie grove not far away they spide,
That promist ayde the tempest to withstand:
Whose loftie trees yclad with sommers pride,
Did spred so broad, that heavens light did hide,
Not perceable with power of any starre:
And all within were pathes and alleies wide,
With footing worne, and leading inward farre:
Faire harbour that them seemes; so in they entred arre.

viii
And foorth they passe, with pleasure forward led,
Joying to heare the birdes sweete harmony,
Which therein shrouded from the tempest dred,
Seemd in their song to scorne the cruell sky.
Much can they prayse the trees so straight and hy,
The sayling Pine, the Cedar proud and tall,
The vine-prop Elme, the Poplar never dry,
The builder Oake, sole king of forrests all,
The Aspine good for staves, the Cypresse funerall.

ix
The Laurell, meed of mightie Conquerours
And Poets sage, the Firre that weepeth still,
The Willow worne of forlorne Paramours,
The Eugh obedient to the benders will,
The Birch for shaftes, the Sallow for the mill,
The Mirrhe sweete bleeding in the bitter wound,
The warlike Beech, the Ash for nothing ill,
The fruitfull Olive, and the Platane round,
The carver Holme, the Maple seeldom inward sound.

x
Led with delight, they thus beguile the way,
Untill the blustring storme is overblowne;
When weening to returne, whence they did stray,
They cannot find that path, which first was showne,
But wander too and fro in wayes unknowne,
Furthest from end then, when they neerest weene,
That makes them doubt, their wits be not their owne:
So many pathes, so many turnings seene,
That which of them to take, in diverse doubt they been.

xi
At last resolving forward still to fare,
Till that some end they finde or in or out,
That path they take, that beaten seemd most bare,
And like to lead the labyrinth about;
Which when by tract they hunted had throughout,
At length it brought them to a hollow cave,
Amid the thickest woods. The Champion stout
Eftsoones dismounted from his courser brave,
And to the Dwarfe a while his needlesse spere he gave.

xii
Be well aware, quoth then that Ladie milde,
Least suddaine mischiefe ye too rash provoke:
The danger hid, the place unknowne and wilde,
Breeds dreadfull doubts: Oft fire is without smoke,
And perill without show: therefore your stroke
Sir knight with-hold, till further triall made.
Ah Ladie (said he) shame were to revoke
The forward footing for an hidden shade:
Vertue gives her selfe light, through darkenesse for to wade.

xiii
Yea but (quoth she) the perill of this place
I better wot then you, though now too late
To wish you backe returne with foule disgrace,
Yet wisedome warnes, whilest foot is in the gate,
To stay the steppe, ere forced to retrate.
This is the wandring wood, this Errours den,
A monster vile, whom God and man does hate:
Therefore I read beware. Fly fly (quoth then
The fearefull Dwarfe:) this is no place for living men.

xiv
But full of fire and greedy hardiment,
The youthfull knight could not for ought be staide,
But forth unto the darksome hole he went,
And looked in: his glistring armor made
A litle glooming light, much like a shade,
By which he saw the ugly monster plaine,
Halfe like a serpent horribly displaide,
But th'other halfe did womans shape retaine,
Most lothsom, filthie, foule, and full of vile disdaine.

xv
And as she lay upon the durtie ground,
Her huge long taile her den all overspred,
Yet was in knots and many boughtes upwound,
Pointed with mortall sting. Of her there bred
A thousand yong ones, which she dayly fed,
Sucking upon her poisonous dugs, eachone
Of sundry shapes, yet all ill favored:
Soone as that uncouth light upon them shone,
Into her mouth they crept, and suddain all were gone.

xvi
Their dam upstart, out of her den effraide,
And rushed forth, hurling her hideous taile
About her cursed head, whose folds displaid
Were stretcht now forth at length without entraile.
She lookt about, and seeing one in mayle
Armed to point, "
"Long have I longd to see my love againe,
Still have I wisht, but never could obtaine it;
Rather than all the world (if I might gaine it)
Would I desire my loves sweet precious gaine.
Yet in my soule I see him everie day,
See him, and see his still sterne countenaunce,
But (ah) what is of long continuance,
Where majestie and beautie beares the sway?
Sometimes, when I imagine that I see him,
(As love is full of foolish fantasies)
Weening to kisse his lips, as my loves fees,
I feele but aire: nothing but aire to bee him.
Thus with Ixion, kisse I clouds in vaine:
Thus with Ixion, feele I endles paine."
"Cherry-lipt Adonis in his snowie shape,
    Might not compare with his pure ivorie white,
    On whose faire front a poets pen may write,
Whose roseate red excels the crimson grape,
His love-enticing delicate soft limbs,
    Are rarely framd tintrap poore gazine eies:
    His cheeks, the lillie and carnation dies,
With lovely tincture which Apollos dims.
His lips ripe strawberries in nectar wet,
    His mouth a Hive, his tongue a hony-combe,
    Where Muses (like bees) make their mansion.
His teeth pure pearle in blushing correll set.
    Oh how can such a body sinne-procuring,
    Be slow to love, and quicke to hate, enduring?"
"Praisd be Dianas fair and harmless light;
Praisd be the dews wherewith she moists the ground;
Praisd be her beams, the glory of the night;
Praisd be her power by which all powers abound.

Praisd be her nymphs with whom she decks the woods,
Praisd be her knights in whom true honour lives;
Praisd be that force by which she moves the floods;
Let that Diana shine which all these gives.

In heaven queen she is among the spheres;
In aye she mistress-like makes all things pure;
Eternity in her oft change she bears;
She beauty is; by her the fair endure.

Time wears her not: she doth his chariot guide;
Mortality below her orb is placd;
By her the virtue of the stars down slide;
In her is virtues perfect image cast.

         A knowledge pure it is her worth to know:
         With Circes let them dwell that think not so."
"When I was fair and young, then favor graced me.
Of many was I sought their mistress for to be.
But I did scorn them all and answered them therefore:
Go, go, go, seek some other where; importune me no more.

How many weeping eyes I made to pine in woe,
How many sighing hearts I have not skill to show,
But I the prouder grew and still this spake therefore:
Go, go, go, seek some other where, importune me no more.

Then spake fair Venus son, that proud victorious boy,
Saying: You dainty dame, for that you be so coy,
I will so pluck your plumes as you shall say no more:
Go, go, go, seek some other where, importune me no more.

As soon as he had said, such change grew in my breast
That neither night nor day I could take any rest.
Wherefore I did repent that I had said before:
Go, go, go, seek some other where, importune me no more."
"When by thy scorn, O murd'ress, I am dead
         And that thou think'st thee free
From all solicitation from me,
Then shall my ghost come to thy bed,
And thee, feign'd vestal, in worse arms shall see;
Then thy sick taper will begin to wink,
And he, whose thou art then, being tir'd before,
Will, if thou stir, or pinch to wake him, think
         Thou call'st for more,
And in false sleep will from thee shrink;
And then, poor aspen wretch, neglected thou
Bath'd in a cold quicksilver sweat wilt lie
         A verier ghost than I.
What I will say, I will not tell thee now,
Lest that preserve thee; and since my love is spent,
I'had rather thou shouldst painfully repent,
Than by my threat'nings rest still innocent."
"Pla ce bo,
Who is there, who?
Di le xi,
Dame Margery;
Fa, re, my, my,
Wherfore and why, why?
For the sowle of Philip Sparowe,
That was late slayn at Carowe,
Among the Nones Blake,
For that swete soules sake,
And for all sparowes soules,
Set in our bederolles,
Pater noster qui,
With an Ave Mari,
And with the corner of a Crede,
The more shalbe your mede.

Whan I remembre agayn
How mi Philyp was slayn,
Never halfe the payne
Was betwene you twayne,
Pyramus and Thesbe,
As than befell to me:
I wept and I wayled,
The tearys downe hayled;
But nothinge it avayled
To call Phylyp agayne,
Whom Gyb our cat hath slayne.

Gib, I saye, our cat,
Worrowyd her on that
Which I loved best:
It can not be exprest
My sorowfull hevynesse,
But all without redresse;
For within that stounde,
Halfe slumbrynge, in a swounde
I fell downe to the grounde.

Unneth I kest myne eyes
Towarde the cloudy skyes:
But whan I dyd beholde
My sparow dead and colde,
No creatuer but that wolde
Have rewed upon me,
To behold and se
What hevynesse dyd me pange;
Wherewith my handes I wrange,
That my senaws cracked,
As though I had ben racked,
So payned and so strayned,
That no lyfe wellnye remayned.

I syghed and I sobbed,
For that I was robbed
Of my sparowes lyfe.
O mayden, wydow, and wyfe,
Of what estate ye be,
Of hye or lowe degre,
Great sorowe than ye myght se,
And lerne to wepe at me!
Such paynes dyd me frete,
That myne hert dyd bete,
My vysage pale and dead,
Wanne, and blewe as lead;
The panges of hatefull death
Wellnye had stopped my breath.
Heu, heu, me,
That I am wo for the!
Ad Dominum, cum tribularer, clamavi:
Of God nothynge els crave I
But Phyllypes soule to kepe
From the marees deepe
Of Acherontes well,
That is a flode of hell;
And from the great Pluto,
The prynce of endles wo;
And from foule Alecto,
With vysage blacke and blo;
And from Medusa, that mare,
That lyke a fende doth stare;
And from Megeras edders,
For rufflynge of Phillips fethers,
And from her fyry sparklynges,
For burnynge of his wynges;
And from the smokes sowre
Of Proserpinas bowre;
And from the dennes darke,
Wher Cerberus doth barke,
Whom Theseus dyd afraye,
Whom Hercules dyd outraye,
As famous poetes say;
From that hell-hounde,
That lyeth in cheynes bounde,
With gastly hedes thre,
To Jupyter pray we
That Phyllyp preserved may be!
Amen, say ye with me!

Do mi nus,
Helpe nowe, swete Jesus!
Levavi oculos meos in montes:
Wolde God I had Zenophontes,
Or Socrates the wyse
To shew me their devyse,
Moderatly to take
This sorrow that I make
For Phylyp Sparowes sake!
So fervently I shake,
I fele my body quake;
So urgently I am brought
Into carefull thought.
Like Andromach, Hectors wyfe,
Was wery of her lyfe,
Whan she had lost her joye,
Noble Hector of Troye;
In lyke maner also
Encreaseth my dedly wo,
For my sparowe is go.

It was so prety a fole,
It wold syt on a stole,
And lerned after my scole
For to kepe his cut,
With, ""Phyllyp, kepe your cut!""

It had a velvet cap,
And wold syt upon my lap,
And seke after small wormes,
And somtyme white bred crommes;
And many tymes and ofte
Betwene my brestes softe
It wolde lye and rest;
It was propre and prest.

Somtyme he wolde gaspe
Whan he sawe a waspe;
A fly or a gnat,
He wolde flye at that;
And prytely he wold pant
Whan he saw an ant;
Lord, how he wolde pry
After the butterfly!
Lorde, how he wolde hop
After the gressop!
And whan I sayd, ""Phyp! Phyp!""
Than he wold lepe and skyp,
And take me by the lyp.
Alas, it wyll me slo,
That Phillyp is gone me fro!"
"Ye learned sisters which have oftentimes
Beene to me ayding, others to adorne:
Whom ye thought worthy of your gracefull rymes,
That even the greatest did not greatly scorne
To heare theyr names sung in your simple layes,
But joyed in theyr prayse.
And when ye list your owne mishaps to mourne,
Which death, or love, or fortunes wreck did rayse,
Your string could soone to sadder tenor turne,
And teach the woods and waters to lament
Your dolefull dreriment.
Now lay those sorrowfull complaints aside,
And having all your heads with girland crownd,
Helpe me mine owne loves prayses to resound,
Ne let the same of any be envide:
So Orpheus did for his owne bride,
So I unto my selfe alone will sing,
The woods shall to me answer and my Eccho ring.

Early before the worlds light giving lampe,
His golden beame upon the hils doth spred,
Having disperst the nights unchearefull dampe,
Doe ye awake, and with fresh lusty hed,
Go to the bowre of my beloved love,
My truest turtle dove,
Bid her awake; for Hymen is awake,
And long since ready forth his maske to move,
With his bright Tead that flames with many a flake,
And many a bachelor to waite on him,
In theyr fresh garments trim.
Bid her awake therefore and soone her dight,
For lo the wished day is come at last,
That shall for al the paynes and sorrowes past,
Pay to her usury of long delight:
And whylest she doth her dight,
Doe ye to her of joy and solace sing,
That all the woods may answer and your eccho ring.

Bring with you all the Nymphes that you can heare
Both of the rivers and the forrests greene:
And of the sea that neighbours to her neare,
Al with gay girlands goodly wel beseene.
And let them also with them bring in hand
Another gay girland
For my fayre love of lillyes and of roses,
Bound truelove wize with a blew silke riband.
And let them make great store of bridale poses,
And let them eeke bring store of other flowers
To deck the bridale bowers.
And let the ground whereas her foot shall tread,
For feare the stones her tender foot should wrong
Be strewed with fragrant flowers all along,
And diapred lyke the discolored mead.
Which done, doe at her chamber dore awayt,
For she will waken strayt,
The whiles doe ye this song unto her sing,
The woods shall to you answer and your Eccho ring.

Ye Nymphes of Mulla which with carefull heed,
The silver scaly trouts doe tend full well,
And greedy pikes which use therein to feed,
(Those trouts and pikes all others doo excell)
And ye likewise which keepe the rushy lake,
Where none doo fishes take,
Bynd up the locks the which hang scatterd light,
And in his waters which your mirror make,
Behold your faces as the christall bright,
That when you come whereas my love doth lie,
No blemish she may spie.
And eke ye lightfoot mayds which keepe the deere,
That on the hoary mountayne use to towre,
And the wylde wolves which seeke them to devoure,
With your steele darts doo chace from comming neer,
Be also present heere,
To helpe to decke her and to help to sing,
That all the woods may answer and your eccho ring.

Wake, now my love, awake; for it is time,
The Rosy Morne long since left Tithones bed,
All ready to her silver coche to clyme,
And Phoebus gins to shew his glorious hed.
Hark how the cheerefull birds do chaunt theyr laies
And carroll of loves praise.
The merry Larke hir mattins sings aloft,
The thrush replyes, the Mavis descant playes,
The Ouzell shrills, the Ruddock warbles soft,
So goodly all agree with sweet consent,
To this dayes merriment.
Ah my deere love why doe ye sleepe thus long,
When meeter were that ye should now awake,
T'awayt the comming of your joyous make,
And hearken to the birds lovelearned song,
The deawy leaves among.
For they of joy and pleasance to you sing,
That all the woods them answer and theyr eccho ring.

My love is now awake out of her dreames,
And her fayre eyes like stars that dimmed were
With darksome cloud, now shew theyr goodly beames
More bright then Hesperus his head doth rere.
Come now ye damzels, daughters of delight,
Helpe quickly her to dight,
But first come ye fayre houres which were begot
In Joves sweet paradice, of Day and Night,
Which doe the seasons of the yeare allot,
And al that ever in this world is fayre
Doe make and still repayre.
And ye three handmayds of the Cyprian Queene,
The which doe still adorne her beauties pride,
Helpe to addorne my beautifullest bride:
And as ye her array, still throw betweene
Some graces to be seene,
And as ye use to Venus, to her sing,
The whiles the woods shal answer and your eccho ring.

Now is my love all ready forth to come,
Let all the virgins therefore well awayt,
And ye fresh boyes that tend upon her groome
Prepare your selves; for he is comming strayt.
Set all your things in seemely good aray
Fit for so joyfull day,
The joyfulst day that ever sunne did see.
Faire Sun, shew forth thy favourable ray,
And let thy lifull heat not fervent be
For feare of burning her sunshyny face,
Her beauty to disgrace.
O fayrest Phoebus, father of the Muse,
If ever I did honour thee aright,
Or sing the thing, that mote thy mind delight,
Doe not thy servants simple boone refuse,
But let this day let this one day be myne,
Let all the rest be thine.
Then I thy soverayne prayses loud will sing,
That all the woods shal answer and theyr eccho ring.

Harke how the Minstrels gin to shrill aloud
Their merry Musick that resounds from far,
The pipe, the tabor, and the trembling Croud,
That well agree withouten breach or jar.
But most of all the Damzels doe delite,
When they their tymbrels smyte,
And thereunto doe daunce and carrol sweet,
That all the sences they doe ravish quite,
The whyles the boyes run up and downe the street,
Crying aloud with strong confused noyce,
As if it were one voyce.
Hymen io Hymen, Hymen they do shout,
That even to the heavens theyr shouting shrill
Doth reach, and all the firmament doth fill,
To which the people standing all about,
As in approvance doe thereto applaud
And loud advaunce her laud,
And evermore they Hymen Hymen sing,
That al the woods them answer and theyr eccho ring.

Loe where she comes along with portly pace
Lyke Phoebe from her chamber of the East,
Arysing forth to run her mighty race,
Clad all in white, that seemes a virgin best.
So well it her beseemes that ye would weene
Some angell she had beene.
Her long loose yellow locks lyke golden wyre,
Sprinckled with perle, and perling flowres a tweene,
Doe lyke a golden mantle her attyre,
And being crowned with a girland greene,
Seeme lyke some mayden Queene.
Her modest eyes abashed to behold
So many gazers, as on her do stare,
Upon the lowly ground affixed are.
Ne dare lift up her countenance too bold,
But blush to heare her prayses sung so loud,
So farre from being proud.
Nathlesse doe ye still loud her prayses sing,
That all the woods may answer and your eccho ring.

Tell me ye merchants daughters did ye see
So fayre a creature in your towne before?
So sweet, so lovely, and so mild as she,
Adornd with beautyes grace and vertues store,
Her goodly eyes lyke Saphyres shining bright,
Her forehead yvory white,
Her cheekes lyke apples which the sun hath rudded,
Her lips lyke cherryes charming men to byte,
Her brest like to a bowle of creame uncrudded,
Her paps lyke lyllies budded,
Her snowie necke lyke to a marble towre,
And all her body like a pallace fayre,
Ascending uppe with many a stately stayre,
To honors seat and chastities sweet bowre.
Why stand ye still ye virgins in amaze,
Upon her so to gaze,
Whiles ye forget your former lay to sing,
To which the woods did answer and your eccho ring.

But if ye saw that which no eyes can see,
The inward beauty of her lively spright,
Garnisht with heavenly guifts of high degree,
Much more then would ye wonder at that sight,
And stand astonisht lyke to those which red
Medusaes mazeful hed.
There dwels sweet love and constant chastity,
Unspotted fayth and comely womenhed,
Regard of honour and mild modesty,
There vertue raynes as Queene in royal throne,
And giveth lawes alone."
"On Hellespont, guilty of true love's blood,
In view and opposite two cities stood,
Sea-borderers, disjoin'd by Neptune's might;
The one Abydos, the other Sestos hight.
At Sestos Hero dwelt; Hero the fair,
Whom young Apollo courted for her hair,
And offer'd as a dower his burning throne,
Where she could sit for men to gaze upon.
The outside of her garments were of lawn,
The lining purple silk, with gilt stars drawn;
Her wide sleeves green, and border'd with a grove,
Where Venus in her naked glory strove
To please the careless and disdainful eyes
Of proud Adonis, that before her lies;
Her kirtle blue, whereon was many a stain,
Made with the blood of wretched lovers slain.
Upon her head she ware a myrtle wreath,
From whence her veil reach'd to the ground beneath;
Her veil was artificial flowers and leaves,
Whose workmanship both man and beast deceives;
Many would praise the sweet smell as she past,
When 'twas the odour which her breath forth cast;
And there for honey bees have sought in vain,
And beat from thence, have lighted there again.
About her neck hung chains of pebble-stone,
Which lighten'd by her neck, like diamonds shone.
She ware no gloves; for neither sun nor wind
Would burn or parch her hands, but, to her mind,
Or warm or cool them, for they took delight
To play upon those hands, they were so white.
Buskins of shells, all silver'd, used she,
And branch'd with blushing coral to the knee;
Where sparrows perch'd, of hollow pearl and gold,
Such as the world would wonder to behold:
Those with sweet water oft her handmaid fills,
Which as she went, would chirrup through the bills.
Some say, for her the fairest Cupid pin'd,
And looking in her face, was strooken blind.
But this is true; so like was one the other,
As he imagin'd Hero was his mother;
And oftentimes into her bosom flew,
About her naked neck his bare arms threw,
And laid his childish head upon her breast,
And with still panting rock'd there took his rest.
So lovely-fair was Hero, Venus' nun,
As Nature wept, thinking she was undone,
Because she took more from her than she left,
And of such wondrous beauty her bereft:
Therefore, in sign her treasure suffer'd wrack,
Since Hero's time hath half the world been black.

         Amorous Leander, beautiful and young
(Whose tragedy divine Musus sung),
Dwelt at Abydos; since him dwelt there none
For whom succeeding times make greater moan.
His dangling tresses, that were never shorn,
Had they been cut, and unto Colchos borne,
Would have allur'd the vent'rous youth of Greece
To hazard more than for the golden fleece.
Fair Cynthia wish'd his arms might be her sphere;
Grief makes her pale, because she moves not there.
His body was as straight as Circe's wand;
Jove might have sipt out nectar from his hand.
Even as delicious meat is to the taste,
So was his neck in touching, and surpast
The white of Pelops' shoulder: I could tell ye,
How smooth his breast was, and how white his belly;
And whose immortal fingers did imprint
That heavenly path with many a curious dint
That runs along his back; but my rude pen
Can hardly blazon forth the loves of men,
Much less of powerful gods: let it suffice
That my slack Muse sings of Leander's eyes;
Those orient cheeks and lips, exceeding his
That leapt into the water for a kiss
Of his own shadow, and, despising many,
Died ere he could enjoy the love of any.
Had wild Hippolytus Leander seen,
Enamour'd of his beauty had he been.
His presence made the rudest peasant melt,
That in the vast uplandish country dwelt;
The barbarous Thracian soldier, mov'd with nought,
Was mov'd with him, and for his favour sought.
Some swore he was a maid in man's attire,
For in his looks were all that men desire,
A pleasant smiling cheek, a speaking eye,
A brow for love to banquet royally;
And such as knew he was a man, would say,
""Leander, thou art made for amorous play;
Why art thou not in love, and lov'd of all?
Though thou be fair, yet be not thine own thrall.""

         The men of wealthy Sestos every year,
For his sake whom their goddess held so dear,
Rose-cheek'd Adonis, kept a solemn feast.
Thither resorted many a wandering guest
To meet their loves; such as had none at all
Came lovers home from this great festival;
For every street, like to a firmament,
Glister'd with breathing stars, who, where they went,
Frighted the melancholy earth, which deem'd
Eternal heaven to burn, for so it seem'd
As if another Pha{""e}ton had got
The guidance of the sun's rich chariot.
But far above the loveliest, Hero shin'd,
And stole away th' enchanted gazer's mind;
For like sea-nymphs' inveigling harmony,
So was her beauty to the standers-by;
Nor that night-wandering, pale, and watery star
(When yawning dragons draw her thirling car
From Latmus' mount up to the gloomy sky,
Where, crown'd with blazing light and majesty,
She proudly sits) more over-rules the flood
Than she the hearts of those that near her stood.
Even as when gaudy nymphs pursue the chase,
Wretched Ixion's shaggy-footed race,
Incens'd with savage heat, gallop amain
From steep pine-bearing mountains to the plain,
So ran the people forth to gaze upon her,
And all that view'd her were enamour'd on her.
And as in fury of a dreadful fight,
Their fellows being slain or put to flight,
Poor soldiers stand with fear of death dead-strooken,
So at her presence all surpris'd and tooken,
Await the sentence of her scornful eyes;
He whom she favours lives; the other dies.
There might you see one sigh, another rage,
And some, their violent passions to assuage,
Compile sharp satires; but, alas, too late,
For faithful love will never turn to hate.
And many, seeing great princes were denied,
Pin'd as they went, and thinking on her, died.
On this feast-dayO cursed day and hour!
Went Hero thorough Sestos, from her tower
To Venus' temple, where unhappily,
As after chanc'd, they did each other spy.
So fair a church as this had Venus none:
The walls were of discolour'd jasper-stone,
Wherein was Proteus carved; and over-head
A lively vine of green sea-agate spread,
Where by one hand light-headed Bacchus hung,
And with the other wine from grapes out-wrung.
Of crystal shining fair the pavement was;
The town of Sestos call'd it Venus' glass:
There might you see the gods in sundry shapes,
Committing heady riots, incest, rapes:
For know, that underneath this radiant flower
Was Danae's statue in a brazen tower,
Jove slyly stealing from his sister's bed,
To dally with Idalian Ganimed,
And for his love Europa bellowing loud,
And tumbling with the rainbow in a cloud;
Blood-quaffing Mars heaving the iron net,
Which limping Vulcan and his Cyclops set;
Love kindling fire, to burn such towns as Troy,
Sylvanus weeping for the lovely boy
That now is turn'd into a cypress tree,
Under whose shade the wood-gods love to be.
And in the midst a silver altar stood:
There Hero, sacrificing turtles' blood,
Vail'd to the ground, veiling her eyelids close;
And modestly they opened as she rose.
Thence flew Love's arrow with the golden head;
And thus Leander was enamoured.
Stone-still he stood, and evermore he gazed,
Till with the fire that from his count'nance blazed
Relenting Hero's gentle heart was strook:
Such force and virtue hath an amorous look.

         It lies not in our power to love or hate,
For will in us is over-rul'd by fate.
When two are stript, long ere the course begin,
We wish that one should lose, the other win;
And one especially do we affect
Of two gold ingots, like in each respect:
The reason no man knows, let it suffice,
What we behold is censur'd by our eyes.
Where both deliberate, the love is slight:
Who ever lov'd, that lov'd not at first sight?"
"By that he ended had his ghostly sermon,
The fox was well induc'd to be a parson,
And of the priest eftsoons gan to inquire,
How to a benefice he might aspire.
""Marry, there"" (said the priest) ""is art indeed:
Much good deep learning one thereout may read;
For that the ground-work is, and end of all,
How to obtain a beneficial.
First, therefore, when ye have in handsome wise
Yourself attired, as you can devise,
Then to some nobleman yourself apply,
Or other great one in the worldes eye,
That hath a zealous disposition
To God, and so to his religion.
There must thou fashion eke a godly zeal,
Such as no carpers may contrare reveal;
For each thing feigned ought more wary be.
There thou must walk in sober gravity,
And seem as saint-like as Saint Radegund:
Fast much, pray oft, look lowly on the ground,
And unto every one do courtesy meek:
These looks (nought saying) do a benefice seek,
But be thou sure one not to lack or long.
And if thee list unto the court to throng,
And there to hunt after the hoped prey,
Then must thou thee dispose another way:
For there thou needs must learn to laugh, to lie,
To face, to forge, to scoff, to company,
To crouch, to please, to be a beetle-stock
Of thy great master's will, to scorn, or mock.
So may'st thou chance mock out a benefice,
Unless thou canst one conjure by device,
Or cast a figure for a bishopric;
And if one could, it were but a school trick.
These be the ways by which without reward
Livings in court be gotten, though full hard;
For nothing there is done without a fee:
The courtier needs must recompensed be
With a benevolence, or have in gage
The primitias of your parsonage:
Scarce can a bishopric forpass them by,
But that it must be gelt in privity.
Do not thou therefore seek a living there,
But of more private persons seek elsewhere,
Whereas thou may'st compound a better penny,
Ne let thy learning question'd be of any.
For some good gentleman, that hath the right
Unto his church for to present a wight,
Will cope with thee in reasonable wise;
That if the living yearly do arise
To forty pound, that then his youngest son
Shall twenty have, and twenty thou hast won:
Thou hast it won, for it is of frank gift,
And he will care for all the rest to shift,
Both that the bishop may admit of thee,
And that therein thou may'st maintained be.
This is the way for one that is unlearn'd
Living to get, and not to be discern'd.
But they that are great clerks, have nearer ways,
For learning sake to living them to raise;
Yet many eke of them (God wot) are driven
T' accept a benefice in pieces riven.
How say'st thou (friend), have I not well discourst
Upon this common-place (though plain, not worst)?
Better a short tale than a bad long shriving.
Needs any more to learn to get a living?""

""Now sure, and by my halidom,"" (quoth he)
""Ye a great master are in your degree:
Great thanks I yield you for your discipline,
And do not doubt but duly to incline
My wits thereto, as ye shall shortly hear.""
The priest him wish'd good speed, and well to fare:
So parted they, as either's way them led.
But th' ape and fox ere long so well them sped,
Through the priest's wholesome counsel lately taught,
And through their own fair handling wisely wrought,
That they a benefice 'twixt them obtained;
And crafty Reynold was a priest ordained,
And th' ape his parish clerk procur'd to be.
Then made they revel rout and goodly glee;
But, ere long time had passed, they so ill
Did order their affairs, that th' evil will
Of all their parish'ners they had constrain'd;
Who to the Ordinary of them complain'd,
How foully they their offices abus'd,
And them of crimes and heresies accus'd,
That pursuivants he often for them sent;
But they neglected his commandement.
So long persisted obstinate and bold,
Till at the length he published to hold
A visitation, and them cited thether:
Then was high time their wits about to geather.
What did they then, but made a composition
With their next neighbour priest, for light condition,
To whom their living they resigned quite
For a few pence, and ran away by night."
"CALM was the day, and through the trembling air
Sweet breathing Zephyrus did softly play,
A gentle spirit, that lightly did delay
Hot Titan's beams, which then did glister fair;
When I whose sullen care,
Through discontent of my long fruitless stay
In prince's court, and expectation vain
Of idle hopes, which still do fly away
Like empty shadows, did afflict my brain,
Walked forth to ease my pain
Along the shore of silver streaming Thames,
Whose rutty bank, the which his river hems,
Was painted all with variable flowers,
And all the meads adorned with dainty gems,
Fit to deck maidens' bowers,
And crown their paramours,
Against the bridal day, which is not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

There, in a meadow, by the river's side,
A flock of nymphs I chanced to espy,
All lovely daughters of the flood thereby,
With goodly greenish locks, all loose untied,
As each had been a bride;
And each one had a little wicker basket,
Made of fine twigs, entrailed curiously,
In which they gathered flowers to fill their flasket,
And with fine fingers cropt full featously
The tender stalks on high.
Of every sort, which in that meadow grew,
They gathered some; the violet pallid blue,
The little daisy, that at evening closes,
The virgin lily, and the primrose true,
With store of vermeil roses,
To deck their bridegrooms' posies
Against the bridal day, which was not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

With that, I saw two swans of goodly hue
Come softly swimming down along the Lee;
Two fairer birds I yet did never see.
The snow which doth the top of Pindus strew,
Did never whiter shew,
Nor Jove himself, when he a swan would be
For love of Leda, whiter did appear:
Yet Leda was they say as white as he,
Yet not so white as these, nor nothing near.
So purely white they were,
That even the gentle stream, the which them bare,
Seemed foul to them, and bade his billows spare
To wet their silken feathers, lest they might
Soil their fair plumes with water not so fair,
And mar their beauties bright,
That shone as heaven's light,
Against their bridal day, which was not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

Eftsoons the nymphs, which now had flowers their fill,
Ran all in haste, to see that silver brood,
As they came floating on the crystal flood.
Whom when they saw, they stood amazed still,
Their wondering eyes to fill.
Them seemed they never saw a sight so fair,
Of fowls so lovely, that they sure did deem
Them heavenly born, or to be that same pair
Which through the sky draw Venus' silver team;
For sure they did not seem
To be begot of any earthly seed,
But rather angels, or of angels' breed:
Yet were they bred of Somers-heat they say,
In sweetest season, when each flower and weed
The earth did fresh array,
So fresh they seemed as day,
Even as their bridal day, which was not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

Then forth they all out of their baskets drew
Great store of flowers, the honour of the field,
That to the sense did fragrant odours yield,
All which upon those goodly birds they threw,
And all the waves did strew,
That like old Peneus' waters they did seem,
When down along by pleasant Tempe's shore,
Scattered with flowers, through Thessaly they stream,
That they appear through lilies' plenteous store,
Like a bride's chamber floor.
Two of those nymphs meanwhile, two garlands bound,
Of freshest flowers which in that mead they found,
The which presenting all in trim array,
Their snowy foreheads therewithal they crowned,
Whilst one did sing this lay,
Prepared against that day,
Against their bridal day, which was not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

'Ye gentle birds, the world's fair ornament,
And heaven's glory, whom this happy hour
Doth lead unto your lovers' blissful bower,
Joy may you have and gentle heart's content
Of your love's complement:
And let fair Venus, that is queen of love,
With her heart-quelling son upon you smile,
Whose smile, they say, hath virtue to remove
All love's dislike, and friendship's faulty guile
For ever to assoil.
Let endless peace your steadfast hearts accord,
And blessed plenty wait upon your board,
And let your bed with pleasures chaste abound,
That fruitful issue may to you afford,
Which may your foes confound,
And make your joys redound
Upon your bridal day, which is not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.'

So ended she; and all the rest around
To her redoubled that her undersong,
Which said their bridal day should not be long.
And gentle echo from the neighbour ground
Their accents did resound.
So forth those joyous birds did pass along,
Adown the Lee, that to them murmured low,
As he would speak, but that he lacked a tongue,
Yet did by signs his glad affection show,
Making his stream run slow.
And all the fowl which in his flood did dwell
Gan flock about these twain, that did excel
The rest so far as Cynthia doth shend
The lesser stars. So they, enranged well,
Did on those two attend,
And their best service lend,
Against their wedding day, which was not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

At length they all to merry London came,
To merry London, my most kindly nurse,
That to me gave this life's first native source;
Though from another place I take my name,
An house of ancient fame.
There when they came, whereas those bricky towers,
The which on Thames' broad aged back do ride,
Where now the studious lawyers have their bowers
There whilom wont the Templar Knights to bide,
Till they decayed through pride:
Next whereunto there stands a stately place,
Where oft I gained gifts and goodly grace
Of that great lord, which therein wont to dwell,
Whose want too well now feels my friendless case.
But ah, here fits not well
Old woes but joys to tell
Against the bridal day, which is not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

Yet therein now doth lodge a noble peer,
Great England's glory, and the world's wide wonder,
Whose dreadful name late through all Spain did thunder,
And Hercules' two pillars standing near
Did make to quake and fear:
Fair branch of honour, flower of chivalry,
That fillest England with thy triumph's fame,
Joy have thou of thy noble victory,
And endless happiness of thine own name
That promiseth the same:
That through thy prowess and victorious arms,
Thy country may be freed from foreign harms;
And great Elisa's glorious name may ring
Through all the world, filled with thy wide alarms,
Which some brave Muse may sing
To ages following,
Upon the bridal day, which is not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

From those high towers this noble lord issuing,
Like radiant Hesper when his golden hair
In th'Ocean billows he hath bathed fair,
Descended to the river's open viewing,
With a great train ensuing.
Above the rest were goodly to be seen
Two gentle knights of lovely face and feature
Beseeming well the bower of any queen,
With gifts of wit and ornaments of nature,
Fit for so goodly stature;
That like the twins of Jove they seemed in sight,
Which deck the baldric of the heavens bright.
They two forth pacing to the river's side,
Received those two fair birds, their love's delight;
Which, at th' appointed tide,
Each one did make his bride
Against their bridal day, which is not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song."
"THENOT    &      HOBBINOLL
Tell me good Hobbinoll, what garres thee greete?
What? hath some Wolfe thy tender Lambes ytorne?
Or is thy Bagpype broke, that soundes so sweete?
Or art thou of thy loved lasse forlorne?

Or bene thine eyes attempred to the yeare,
Quenching the gasping furrowes thirst with rayne?
Like April shoure, so stremes the trickling teares
Adowne thy cheeke, to quenche thy thristye payne.

HOBBINOLL
Nor thys, nor that, so muche doeth make me mourne,
But for the ladde, whome long I lovd so deare,
Nowe loves a lasse, that all his love doth scorne:
He plongd in payne, his tressed locks dooth teare.

Shepheards delights he dooth them all forsweare,
Hys pleasaunt Pipe, whych made us meriment,
He wylfully hath broke, and doth forbeare
His wonted songs, wherein he all outwent.

THENOT
What is he for a Ladde, you so lament?
Ys love such pinching payne to them, that prove?
And hath he skill to make so excellent,
Yet hath so little skill to brydle love?

HOBBINOLL
Colin thou kenst, the Southerne shepheardes boye:
Him Love hath wounded with a deadly darte.
Whilome on him was all my care and joye,
Forcing with gyfts to winne his wanton heart.

But now from me hys madding mynd is starte,
And woes the Widdowes daughter of the glenne:
So nowe fayre Rosalind hath bredde hys smart,
So now his frend is chaunged for a frenne.

THENOT
But if hys ditties bene so trimly dight,
I pray thee Hobbinoll, recorde some one:
The whiles our flockes doe graze about in sight,
And we close shrowded in thys shade alone.

HOBBINOLL
Contented I: then will I singe his laye
Of fayre Elisa, Queene of shepheardes all:
Which once he made, as by a spring he laye,
And tuned it unto the Waters fall.

Ye dayntye Nymphs, that in this blessed Brooke
         doe bathe your brest,
Forsake your watry bowres, and hether looke,
         at my request:
And eke you Virgins, that on Parnasse dwell,
Whence floweth Helicon the learned well,
         Helpe me to blaze
         Her worthy praise,
Which in her sexe doth all excell.

Of fayre Eliza be your silver song,
         that blessed wight:
The flowre of Virgins, may shee florish long,
         In princely plight.
For shee is Syrinx daughter without spotte,
Which Pan the shepheards God of her begot:
         So sprong her grace
         Of heavenly race,
No mortall blemishe may her blotte.

See, where she sits upon the grassie greene,
         (O seemely sight)
Yclad in Scarlot like a mayden Queene,
         And Ermines white.
Upon her head a Cremosin coronet,
With Damaske roses and Daffadillies set:
         Bayleaves betweene,
         And Primroses greene
Embellish the sweete Violet.

Tell me, have ye seene her angelick face,
         Like Ph{oe}be fayre?
Her heavenly haveour, her princely grace
         can you well compare?
The Redde rose medled with the White yfere,
In either cheeke depeincten lively chere.
         Her modest eye,
         Her Majestie,
Where have you seene the like, but there?

I sawe Ph{oe}bus thrust out his golden hedde,
         upon her to gaze:
But when he sawe, how broade her beames did spredde,
         it did him amaze.
He blusht to see another Sunne belowe,
Ne durst againe his fyrye face out showe:
         Let him, if he dare,
         His brightnesse compare
With hers, to have the overthrowe.

Shewe thy selfe Cynthia with thy silver rayes,
         and be not abasht:
When shee the beames of her beauty displayes,
         O how art thou dasht?
But I will not match her with Latonaes seede,
Such follie great sorow to Niobe did breede.
         Now she is a stone,
         And makes dayly mone,
Warning all other to take heede.

Pan may be proud, that ever he begot
         such a Bellibone,
And Syrinx rejoyse, that ever was her lot
         to beare such an one.
Soone as my younglings cryen for the dam,
To her will I offer a milkwhite Lamb:
         Shee is my goddesse plaine,
         And I her shepherds swayne,
Albee forswonck and forswatt I am.

I see Calliope speede her to the place,
         where my Goddesse shines:
And after her the other Muses trace,
         with their Violines.
Bene they not Bay braunches, which they doe beare,
All for Elisa in her hand to weare?
         So sweetely they play,
         And sing all the way,
That it a heaven is to heare.

Lo how finely the graces can it foote
         to the Instrument:
They dauncen deffly, and singen soote,
         in their meriment.
Wants not a fourth grace, to make the daunce even?
Let that rowme to my Lady be yeven:
         She shalbe a grace,
         To fyll the fourth place,
And reigne with the rest in heaven.

And whither rennes this bevie of Ladies bright,
         raunged in a rowe?
They bene all Ladyes of the lake behight,
         that unto her goe.
Chloris, that is the chiefest Nymph of al,
Of Olive braunches beares a Coronall:
         Olives bene for peace,
         When wars doe surcease:
Such for a Princesse bene principall.

Ye shepheards daughters, that dwell on the greene,
         hye you there apace:
Let none come there, but that Virgins bene,
         to adorne her grace.
And when you come, whereas shee is in place,
See, that your rudeness doe not you disgrace:
         Binde your fillets faste,
         And gird in your waste,
For more finesse, with a tawdrie lace.

Bring hether the Pincke and purple Cullambine,
         With Gelliflowres:
Bring Coronations, and Sops in wine,
         worne of Paramoures.
Strowe me the ground with Daffadowndillies,
And Cowslips, and Kingcups, and loved Lillies:
         The pretie Pawnce,
         And the Chevisaunce,
Shall match with the fayre flowre Delice.

Now ryse up Elisa, decked as thou art,
         in royall aray:
And now ye daintie Damsells may depart
         echeone her way,
I feare, I have troubled your troupes to longe:
Let dame Eliza thanke you for her song.
         And if you come hether,
         When Damsines I gether,
I will part them all you among.

THENOT
And was thilk same song of Colins owne making?
Ah foolish boy, that is with love yblent:
Great pittie is, he be in such taking,
For naught caren, that bene so lewdly bent.

HOBBINOLL
Sicker I hold him, for a greater fon,
That loves the thing, he cannot purchase.
But let us homeward: for night draweth on,
And twincling starres the daylight hence chase.

THENOTS EMBLEME
O quam te memorem virgo?

"PIERCE       &         CUDDIE
Cuddie, for shame hold up thy heavye head,
And let us cast with what delight to chace,
And weary thys long lingring Phoebus race.
Whilome thou wont the shepheards laddes to leade,
In rymes, in ridles, and in bydding base:
Now they in thee, and thou in sleepe art dead.

CUDDY
Piers, I have pyped erst so long with payne,
That all mine Oten reedes bene rent and wore:
And my poore Muse hath spent her spared store,
Yet little good hath got, and much lesse gayne,
Such pleasaunce makes the Grashopper so poore,
And ligge so layd, when Winter doth her straine.

The dapper ditties, that I wont devise,
To feede youthes fancie, and the flocking fry,
Delighten much: what I the bett for thy?
They han the pleasure, I a sclender prise.
I beate the bush, the byrds to them doe flye:
What good thereof to Cuddie can arise?

PIERS
Cuddie, the prayse is better, then the price,
The glory eke much greater then the gayne:
O what an honor is it, to restraine
The lust of lawlesse youth with good advice:
Or pricke them forth with pleasaunce of thy vaine,
Whereto thou list their trayned willes entice.

Soone as thou gynst to sette thy notes in frame,
O how the rurall routes to thee doe cleave:
Seemeth thou dost their soule of sence bereave,
All as the shepheard, that did fetch his dame
From Plutoes balefull bowre withouten leave:
His musicks might the hellish hound did tame.

CUDDIE
So praysen babes the Peacoks spotted traine,
And wondren at bright Argus blazing eye:
But who rewards him ere the more for thy?
Or feedes him once the fuller by a graine?
Sike prayse is smoke, that sheddeth in the skye,
Sike words bene wynd, and wasten soone in vayne.

PIERS
Abandon then the base and viler clowne,
Lyft up thy selfe out of the lowly dust:
And sing of bloody Mars, of wars, of giusts.
Turne thee to those, that weld the awful crowne,
To doubted Knights, whose woundlesse armour rusts,
And helmes unbruzed wexen dayly browne.

There may thy Muse display her fluttryng wing,
And stretch her selfe at large from East to West:
Whither thou list in fayre Elisa rest,
Or if thee please in bigger notes to sing,
Advaunce the worthy whome shee loveth best,
That first the white beare to the stake did bring.

And when the stubborne stroke of stronger stounds,
Has somewhat slackt the tenor of thy string:
Of love and lustihed tho mayst thou sing,
And carrol lowde, and leade the Myllers rownde,
All were Elisa one of thilke same ring.
So mought our Cuddies name to Heaven sownde.

CUDDYE
Indeed the Romish Tityrus, I heare,
Through his Mecoenas left his Oaten reede,
Whereon he earst had taught his flocks to feede,
And laboured lands to yield the timely eare,
And eft did sing of warres and deadly drede,
So as the Heavens did quake his verse to here.

But ah Mecoenas is yclad in claye,
And great Augustus long ygoe is dead:
And all the worthies liggen wrapt in leade,
That matter made for Poets on to play:
For ever, who in derring doe were dreade,
The loftie verse of hem was loved aye.

But after vertue gan for age to stoupe,
And mighty manhode brought a bedde of ease:
The vaunting Poets found nought worth a pease,
To put in preace emong the learned troupe.
Tho gan the streames of flowing wittes to cease,
And sonnebright honour pend in shamefull coupe.

And if that any buddes of Poesie,
Yet of the old stocke gan to shoote agayne:
Or it mens follies mote be forst to fayne,
And rolle with rest in rymes of rybaudrye:
Or as it sprong, it wither must agayne:
Tom Piper makes us better melodie.

PIERS
O pierlesse Poesye, where is then thy place?
If nor in Princes pallace thou doe sitt:
(And yet is Princes pallace the most fitt)
Ne brest of baser birth doth thee embrace.
Then make thee winges of thine aspyring wit,
And, whence thou camst, flye backe to heaven apace.

CUDDIE
Ah Percy it is all to weake and wanne,
So high to sore, and make so large a flight:
Her peeced pyneons bene not so in plight,
For Colin fittes such famous flight to scanne:
He, were he not with love so ill bedight,
Would mount as high, and sing as soote as Swanne.

PIERS
Ah fon, for love does teach him climbe so hie,
And lyftes him up out of the loathsome myre:
Such immortall mirrhor, as he doth admire,
Would rayse ones mynd above the starry skie.
And cause a caytive corage to aspire,
For lofty love doth loath a lowly eye.

CUDDIE
All otherwise the state of Poet stands,
For lordly love is such a Tyranne fell:
That where he rules, all power he doth expell.
The vaunted verse a vacant head demaundes,
Ne wont with crabbed care the Muses dwell.
Unwisely weaves, that takes two webbes in hand.

Who ever casts to compasse weightye prise,
And thinks to throwe out thondring words of threate:
Let powre in lavish cups and thriftie bitts of meate,
For Bacchus fruite is frend to Phoebus wise.
And when with Wine the braine begins to sweate,
The nombers flowe as fast as spring doth ryse.

Thou kenst not Percie howe the ryme should rage.
O if my temples were distaind with wine,
And girt in girlonds of wild Yvie twine,
How I could reare the Muse on stately stage,
And teache her tread aloft in buskin fine,
With queint Bellona in her equipage.

But ah my corage cooles ere it be warme,
For thy, content us in thys humble shade:
Where no such troublous tydes han us assayde,
Here we our slender pipes may safely charme.

PIERS
And when my Gates shall han their bellies layd:
Cuddie shall have a Kidde to store his farme.

Agitante calescimus illo"
"Go and catch a falling star,
    Get with child a mandrake root,
Tell me where all past years are,
    Or who cleft the devil's foot,
Teach me to hear mermaids singing,
Or to keep off envy's stinging,
            And find
            What wind
Serves to advance an honest mind.

If thou be'st born to strange sights,
    Things invisible to see,
Ride ten thousand days and nights,
    Till age snow white hairs on thee,
Thou, when thou return'st, wilt tell me,
All strange wonders that befell thee,
            And swear,
            No where
Lives a woman true, and fair.

If thou find'st one, let me know,
    Such a pilgrimage were sweet;
Yet do not, I would not go,
    Though at next door we might meet;
Though she were true, when you met her,
And last, till you write your letter,
            Yet she
            Will be
False, ere I come, to two, or three.

"Orpheus with his lute made trees, 
And the mountain tops that freeze, 
Bow themselves when he did sing:
To his music plants and flowers 
Ever sprung; as sun and showers 
There had made a lasting spring. 
Every thing that heard him play, 
Even the billows of the sea, 
Hung their heads, and then lay by. 
In sweet music is such art, 
Killing care and grief of heart 
Fall asleep, or hearing, die."
"What is your substance, whereof are you made,
That millions of strange shadows on you tend?
Since every one hath, every one, one shade,
And you, but one, can every shadow lend.
Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit
Is poorly imitated after you;
On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,
And you in Grecian tires are painted new.
Speak of the spring and foison of the year:
The one doth shadow of your beauty show,
The other as your bounty doth appear;
And you in every blessed shape we know.
    In all external grace you have some part,
    But you like none, none you, for constant heart."
"Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,
And make me travel forth without my cloak,
To let base clouds oertake me in my way,
Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?
Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,
To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,
For no man well of such a salve can speak
That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace:
Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;
Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:
The offenders sorrow lends but weak relief
To him that bears the strong offences cross.
   Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,
   And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.

"The welcome Sun from sea Freake is returned,
And cheereth with his beams the naked earth,
Which gains with his coming her apparel
And had his absence six long months mourned.
Out of her fragrant sides she sends to greet him
The rashed primrose and the violet;
While she the fields and meadows doth beset
With flowers, and hangs the trees with pearl to meet him.
Amid this hope and joy she doth forget,
To kill the hemlock which doth grow too fast,
And chill the adder making too much haste,
With his black sons revived with the heat;
     Till summer comes with diverse colours clad,
      Much like my Epigrams both good and bad."
"I met a courtier riding on the plain,
Well-mounted on a brave and gallant steed;
I sat upon a jade, and spurred to my pain
My lazy beast, whose tired sides did bleed:
He saw my case, and then of courtesy
Did rein his horse, and drew the bridle in,
Because I did desire his company:
But he corvetting way of me did win.
     What should I do, who was besteaded so?
      His horse stood still faster than mine could go."
"Walking the fields a wantcatcher I spied,
To him I went, desirous of his game:
Sir, have you taken wants? Yes, he replied,
Here are a dozen, which were lately taen.
Then you have left no more. No more? quoth he.
Sir I can show you more: the more the worse;
And to his work he went, but 'twould not be,
For all the wants were crept into my purse.
     Farewell friend wantcatcher, since 'twill not be,
     Thou cannot catch the wants, but they catch me."
"Fishing, if I a fisher may protest,
Of pleasures is the sweetest, of sports the best,
Of exercises the most excellent.
Of recreations the most innocent.
But now the sport is marred, and what, ye, why?
Fishes decrease, and fishers multiply."
"Come darkest night, becoming sorrow best;
    Light; leave thy light; fitt for a lightsome soule;
    Darknes doth truly sure with mee oprest
    Whom absence power doth from mirthe controle:

The very trees with hanging heads condole
    Sweet sommers parting, and of leaves distrest
    In dying coulers make a griefe-full role;
    Soe much (alas) to sorrow are they prest,

Thus of dead leaves her farewell carpetts made:
    Theyr fall, theyr branches, all theyr mournings prove;
    With leavles, naked bodies, whose huese vade
    From hopefull greene, to wither in theyr love,

If trees, and leaves for absence, mourners bee
Noe mervaile that I grieve, who like want see."
"Januarie. gloga prima. ARGVMENT.

    IN this fyrst glogue Colin clout a shepheardes boy complaineth him of his vnfortunate loue, being but newly (as semeth) enamoured of a countrie lasse called Rosalinde: with which strong affection being very sore traueled, he compareth his carefull case to the sadde season of the yeare, to the frostie ground, to the frosen trees, and to his owne winterbeaten flocke. And lastlye, fynding himselfe robbed of all former pleasaunce and delights, hee breaketh his Pipe in peeces, and casteth him selfe to the ground.


COLIN Cloute.


A Shepeheards boye (no better doe him call)
when Winters wastful spight was almost spent,
All in a sunneshine day, as did befall,
Led forth his flock, that had been long ypent.
So faynt they woxe, and feeble in the folde,
That now vnnethes their feete could them vphold.


All as the Sheepe, such was the shepeheards looke,
For pale and wanne he was, (alas the while,)
May seeme he lovd, or els some care he tooke:
Well couth he tune his pipe, and frame his stile.
Tho to a hill his faynting flocke he ledde,
And thus him playnd, the while his shepe there fedde.


Ye gods of loue, that pitie louers payne,
(if any gods the paine of louers pitie:)
Looke from aboue, where you in ioyes remaine,
And bowe your eares vnto my doleful dittie.
And Pan thou shepheards God, that once didst loue,
Pitie the paines, that thou thy selfe didst proue.


Thou barrein ground, whome winters wrath hath wasted,
Art made a myrrhour, to behold my plight:
Whilome thy fresh spring flowrd, and after hasted
Thy sommer prowde with Daffadillies dight.
And now is come thy wynters stormy state,
Thy mantle mard, wherein thou mas-kedst late.


Such rage as winters, reigneth in my heart,
My life bloud friesing wtih vnkindly cold:
Such stormy stoures do breede my balefull smarte,
As if my yeare were wast, and woxen old.
And yet alas, but now my spring begonne,
And yet alas, yt is already donne.


You naked trees, whose shady leaves are lost,
Wherein the byrds were wont to build their bowre:
And now are clothd with mosse and hoary frost,
Instede of bloosmes, wherwith your buds did flowre:
I see your teares, that from your boughes doe raine,
Whose drops in drery ysicles remaine.


All so my lustfull leafe is drye and sere,
My timely buds with wayling all are wasted:
The blossome, which my braunch of youth did beare,
With breathed sighes is blowne away, & blasted,
And from mine eyes the drizling teares descend,
As on your boughes the ysicles depend.


Thou feeble flocke, whose fleece is rough and rent,
Whose knees are weak through fast and evill fare:
Mayst witnesse well by thy ill gouernement,
Thy maysters mind is ouercome with care.
Thou weak, I wanne: thou leabe, I quite forlorne:
With mourning pyne I, you with pyning mourne.


A thousand sithes I curse that carefull hower,
Wherein I longd the neighbour towne to see:
And eke tenne thousand sithes I blesse the stoure,
Wherein I sawe so fayre a sight, as shee.
Yet all for naught: snch [such] sight hath bred my bane.
Ah God, that loue should breede both ioy and payne.


It is not Hobbinol, wherefore I plaine,
Albee my loue he seeke with dayly suit:
His clownish gifts and curtsies I disdaine,
His kiddes, his cracknelles, and his early fruit.
Ah foolish Hobbinol, thy gyfts bene vayne:
Colin them gives to Rosalind againe.


I loue thilke lasse, (alas why doe I loue?)
And am forlorne, (alas why am I lorne?)
Shee deignes not my good will, but doth reproue,
And of my rurall musick holdeth scorne.
Shepheards deuise she hateth as the snake,
And laughes the songes, that Colin Clout doth make.


Wherefore my pype, albee rude Pan thou please,
Yet for thou pleasest not, where most I would:
And thou vnlucky Muse, that wontst to ease
My musing mynd, yet canst not, when thou should:
Both pype and Muse, shall sore the while abye.
So broke his oaten pype, and downe dyd lye.


By that, the welked Phoebus gan availe,
His weary waine, and nowe the frosty Night
Her mantle black through heauen gan overhaile.
Which seene, the pensife boy halfe in despight
Arose, and homeward drove his sonned sheepe,
Whose hanging heads did seeme his carefull case to weepe."
"Where the bee sucks, there suck I:
In a cowslips bell I lie;
There I couch when owls do cry.
On the bats back I do fly
After summer merrily.   
Merrily, merrily shall I live now
Under the blossom that hangs on the bough."
"Tis true, tis day, what though it be?
O wilt thou therefore rise from me?
Why should we rise because tis light?
Did we lie down because twas night?
Love, which in spite of darkness brought us hither,
Should in despite of light keep us together.

Light hath no tongue, but is all eye;
If it could speak as well as spy,
This were the worst that it could say,
That being well I fain would stay,
And that I loved my heart and honour so,
That I would not from him, that had them, go.

Must business thee from hence remove?
Oh, thats the worst disease of love,
The poor, the foul, the false, love can
Admit, but not the busied man.
He which hath business, and makes love, doth do
Such wrong, as when a married man doth woo."
"As I in hoary winters night stood shivering in the snow,
Surprisd I was with sudden heat which made my heart to glow;
And lifting up a fearful eye to view what fire was near,
A pretty Babe all burning bright did in the air appear;
Who, scorched with excessive heat, such floods of tears did shed
As though his floods should quench his flames which with his tears were fed.
Alas! quoth he, but newly born, in fiery heats I fry,
Yet none approach to warm their hearts or feel my fire but I!
My faultless breast the furnace is, the fuel wounding thorns,
Love is the fire, and sighs the smoke, the ashes shame and scorns;
The fuel Justice layeth on, and Mercy blows the coals,
The metal in this furnace wrought are mens defiled souls,
For which, as now on fire I am to work them to their good,
      So will I melt into a bath to wash them in my blood.
      With this he vanishd out of sight and swiftly shrunk away,
      And straight I called unto mind that it was Christmas day."
"Care for thy soul as thing of greatest price,
      Made to the end to taste of power divine,
Devoid of guilt, abhorring sin and vice,
      Apt by Gods grace to virtue to incline.
Care for it so as by thy retchless train
It be not brought to taste eternal pain.

Care for thy corse, but chiefly for souls sake;
      Cut off excess, sustaining food is best;
To vanquish pride but comely clothing take;
      Seek after skill, deep ignorance detest.
Care so, I say, the flesh to feed and clothe
That thou harm not thy soul and body both.

Care for the world to do thy body right;
      Rack not thy wit to win thy wicked ways;
Seek not to oppress the weak by wrongful might;
      To pay thy due do banish all delays.
Care to dispend according to thy store,
And in like sort be mindful of the poor.

Care for thy soul, as for thy chiefest stay;
      Care for thy body for thy souls avail;
Care for the world for bodys help alway;
      Care yet but so as virtue may prevail.
Care in such sort that thou be sure of this:
Care keep thee not from heaven and heavenly bliss."
"The doubt of future foes exiles my present joy,
And wit me warns to shun such snares as threaten mine annoy;
For falsehood now doth flow, and subjects faith doth ebb,
Which should not be if reason ruled or wisdom weaved the web.
But clouds of joys untried do cloak aspiring minds,
Which turn to rain of late repent by changed course of winds.
The top of hope supposed the root upreared shall be,
And fruitless all their grafted guile, as shortly ye shall see.
The dazzled eyes with pride, which great ambition blinds,
Shall be unsealed by worthy wights whose foresight falsehood finds.
The daughter of debate that discord aye doth sow
Shall reap no gain where former rule still peace hath taught to know.
No foreign banished wight shall anchor in this port;
Our realm brooks not seditious sects, let them elsewhere resort.
My rusty sword through rest shall first his edge employ
To poll their tops that seek such change or gape for future joy."
"Fie pleasure, fie! thou cloyest me with delight,
Thou fillst my mouth with sweetmeats overmuch;
I wallow still in joy both day and night:
I deem, I dream, I do, I taste, I touch,
No thing but all that smells of perfect bliss;
Fie pleasure, fie! I cannot like of this.

   To taste (sometimes) a bait of bitter gall,
To drink a draught of sour ale (some season)
To eat brown bread with homely hands in hall,
Doth much increase mens appetites, by reason,
And makes the sweet more sugard that ensues,
Since minds of men do still seek after news.

   The pamperd horse is seldom seen in breath,
Whose manger makes his grace (oftimes) to melt;
The crammed fowl comes quickly to his death;
Such colds they catch in hottest haps that swelt;
And I (much like) in pleasure scawled still,
Do fear to starve although I feed my fill.

   It might suffice that Love hath built his bower
Between my ladys lively shining eyes;
It were enough that beautys fading flower
Grows ever fresh with her in heavenly wise;
It had been well that she were fair of face,
And yet not rob all other dames of grace.

   To muse in mind, how wise, how fair, how good,
How brave, how frank, how courteous, and how true
My lady is, doth but inflame my blood
With humours such as bid my health adieu;
Since hap always when it is clomb on high,
Doth fall full low, though erst it reachd the sky.

   Lo, pleasure, lo! lo thus I lead a life
That laughs for joy, and trembleth oft for dread;
Thy pangs are such as call for changes knife
To cut the twist, or else to stretch the thread,
Which holds yfeer the bundle of my bliss:
Fie, pleasure, fie! I dare not trust to this."
"Green groweth the holly,
So doth the ivy.
Though winter blasts blow never so high,
Green groweth the holly.

As the holly groweth green
And never changeth hue,
So I am, ever hath been,
Unto my lady true.

As the holly groweth green
With ivy all alone
When flowers cannot be seen
And greenwood leaves be gone,

Now unto my lady
Promise to her I make,
From all other only
To her I me betake.

Adieu, mine own lady,
Adieu, my special
Who hath my heart truly
Be sure, and ever shall."
"Lucks, my fair falcon, and your fellows all,
   How well pleasant it were your liberty!
Ye not forsake me that fair might ye befall.
But they that sometime liked my company:
Like lice away from dead bodies they crawl.
Lo what a proof in light adversity!
But ye my birds, I swear by all your bells,
Ye be my friends, and so be but few else."
"If all the world and love were young,
And truth in every Shepherds tongue,
These pretty pleasures might me move,
To live with thee, and be thy love.

Time drives the flocks from field to fold,
When Rivers rage and Rocks grow cold,
And Philomel becometh dumb,
The rest complains of cares to come.

The flowers do fade, and wanton fields,
To wayward winter reckoning yields,
A honey tongue, a heart of gall,
Is fancys spring, but sorrows fall.

Thy gowns, thy shoes, thy beds of Roses,
Thy cap, thy kirtle, and thy posies
Soon break, soon wither, soon forgotten:
In folly ripe, in reason rotten.

Thy belt of straw and Ivy buds,
The Coral clasps and amber studs,
All these in me no means can move
To come to thee and be thy love.

But could youth last, and love still breed,
Had joys no date, nor age no need,
Then these delights my mind might move
To live with thee, and be thy love."
"Gut eats all day and lechers all the night;
So all his meat he tasteth over twice;
And, striving so to double his delight,
He makes himself a thoroughfare of vice.
Thus in his belly can he change a sin:
Lust it comes out, that gluttony went in."
"Praisd be Dianas fair and harmless light;
Praisd be the dews wherewith she moists the ground;
Praisd be her beams, the glory of the night;
Praisd be her power by which all powers abound.

Praisd be her nymphs with whom she decks the woods,
Praisd be her knights in whom true honour lives;
Praisd be that force by which she moves the floods;
Let that Diana shine which all these gives.

In heaven queen she is among the spheres;
In aye she mistress-like makes all things pure;
Eternity in her oft change she bears;
She beauty is; by her the fair endure.

Time wears her not: she doth his chariot guide;
Mortality below her orb is placd;
By her the virtue of the stars down slide;
In her is virtues perfect image cast.

         A knowledge pure it is her worth to know:
         With Circes let them dwell that think not so."
"The silver swan, who living had no note,
When death approached, unlocked her silent throat;
Leaning her breast against the reedy shore,
Thus sung her first and last, and sung no more:
Farewell, all joys; Oh death, come close mine eyes;
More geese than swans now live, more fools than wise."
"Blow, blow, thou winter wind,
   Thou art not so unkind
      As mans ingratitude;
   Thy tooth is not so keen,
Because thou art not seen,
      Although thy breath be rude.
Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly:
Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly:
   Then, heigh-ho, the holly!
      This life is most jolly.

   Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,
   That dost not bite so nigh
      As benefits forgot:
   Though thou the waters warp,
      Thy sting is not so sharp
      As friend remembered not.
Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly..."
"When daisies pied and violets blue
      And lady-smocks all silver-white
And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue
      Do paint the meadows with delight,
The cuckoo then, on every tree,
Mocks married men; for thus sings he: 
                                                    Cuckoo;
Cuckoo, cuckoo! O, word of fear,
Unpleasing to a married ear!

When shepherds pipe on oaten straws,
      And merry larks are ploughmen's clocks,
When turtles tread, and rooks, and daws,
      And maidens bleach their summer smocks,
The cuckoo then, on every tree,
Mocks married men; for thus sings he,
                                                    Cuckoo;
Cuckoo, cuckoo! O, word of fear,
Unpleasing to a married ear!

When icicles hang by the wall,
      And Dick the shepherd blows his nail,
And Tom bears logs into the hall,
      And milk comes frozen home in pail,
When blood is nipp'd, and ways be foul,
Then nightly sings the staring-owl,
                                                    Tu-who;
Tu-whit, tu-who!a merry note,
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.

When all aloud the wind doth blow,
      And coughing drowns the parson's saw,
And birds sit brooding in the snow,
      And Marian's nose looks red and raw,
When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,
Then nightly sings the staring owl,
                                                    Tu-who;
Tu-whit, tu-who!a merry note,
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot."
"When that I was and a little tiny boy,
    With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
A foolish thing was but a toy,
    For the rain it raineth every day.

But when I came to mans estate,
    With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate,
    For the rain it raineth every day.

But when I came, alas! to wive,
    With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
By swaggering could I never thrive,
    For the rain it raineth every day.

But when I came unto my beds,
    With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
With toss-pots still had drunken heads,
    For the rain it raineth every day.

A great while ago the world begun,
    With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
But thats all one, our play is done,
    And well strive to please you every day."
"From fairest creatures we desire increase,
That thereby beautys rose might never die,
But as the riper should by time decease,
His tender heir might bear his memory;
But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
Feedst thy lights flame with self-substantial fuel,
Making a famine where abundance lies,
Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.
Though that art now the worlds fresh ornament
And only herald to the gaudy spring,
Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
And, tender churl, makst waste in niggarding.
   Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
   To eat the worlds due, by the grave and thee."
"Shall I compare thee to a summers day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summers lease hath all too short a date;
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance or natures changing course untrimm'd;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owst;
Nor shall death brag thou wanderst in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou growst:
   So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
   So long lives this, and this gives life to thee."
"Spring, the sweet spring, is the years pleasant king,
Then blooms each thing, then maids dance in a ring,
Cold doth not sting, the pretty birds do sing:
      Cuckoo, jug-jug, pu-we, to-witta-woo!

The palm and may make country houses gay,
Lambs frisk and play, the shepherds pipe all day,
And we hear aye birds tune this merry lay:
      Cuckoo, jug-jug, pu-we, to-witta-woo!

The fields breathe sweet, the daisies kiss our feet,
Young lovers meet, old wives a-sunning sit,
In every street these tunes our ears do greet:
      Cuckoo, jug-jug, pu-we, to witta-woo!
            Spring, the sweet spring!"
"When I was fair and young, then favor graced me.
Of many was I sought their mistress for to be.
But I did scorn them all and answered them therefore:
Go, go, go, seek some other where; importune me no more.

How many weeping eyes I made to pine in woe,
How many sighing hearts I have not skill to show,
But I the prouder grew and still this spake therefore:
Go, go, go, seek some other where, importune me no more.

Then spake fair Venus son, that proud victorious boy,
Saying: You dainty dame, for that you be so coy,
I will so pluck your plumes as you shall say no more:
Go, go, go, seek some other where, importune me no more.

As soon as he had said, such change grew in my breast
That neither night nor day I could take any rest.
Wherefore I did repent that I had said before:
Go, go, go, seek some other where, importune me no more."
"No crooked leg, no bleared eye,
No part deformed out of kind,
Nor yet so ugly half can be
As is the inward suspicious mind."
"Twice or thrice had I lov'd thee,
Before I knew thy face or name;
So in a voice, so in a shapeless flame
Angels affect us oft, and worshipp'd be;
         Still when, to where thou wert, I came,
Some lovely glorious nothing I did see.
         But since my soul, whose child love is,
Takes limbs of flesh, and else could nothing do,
         More subtle than the parent is
Love must not be, but take a body too;
         And therefore what thou wert, and who,
                I bid Love ask, and now
That it assume thy body, I allow,
And fix itself in thy lip, eye, and brow.

Whilst thus to ballast love I thought,
And so more steadily to have gone,
With wares which would sink admiration,
I saw I had love's pinnace overfraught;
         Ev'ry thy hair for love to work upon
Is much too much, some fitter must be sought;
         For, nor in nothing, nor in things
Extreme, and scatt'ring bright, can love inhere;
         Then, as an angel, face, and wings
Of air, not pure as it, yet pure, doth wear,
         So thy love may be my love's sphere;
                Just such disparity
As is 'twixt air and angels' purity,
'Twixt women's love, and men's, will ever be."
"With how sad steps, O Moon, thou climb'st the skies!
How silently, and with how wan a face!
What, may it be that even in heav'nly place
That busy archer his sharp arrows tries!
Sure, if that long-with love-acquainted eyes
Can judge of love, thou feel'st a lover's case,
I read it in thy looks; thy languish'd grace
To me, that feel the like, thy state descries.
Then, ev'n of fellowship, O Moon, tell me,
Is constant love deem'd there but want of wit?
Are beauties there as proud as here they be?
Do they above love to be lov'd, and yet
Those lovers scorn whom that love doth possess?
Do they call virtue there ungratefulness?"
"When Nature made her chief work, Stella's eyes,
In colour black why wrapt she beams so bright?
Would she in beamy black, like painter wise,
Frame daintiest lustre, mix'd of shades and light?
Or did she else that sober hue devise,
In object best to knit and strength our sight;
Lest, if no veil these brave gleams did disguise,
They, sunlike, should more dazzle than delight?
Or would she her miraculous power show,
That, whereas black seems beauty's contrary,
She even in black doth make all beauties flow?
Both so, and thus, she, minding Love should be
Plac'd ever there, gave him this mourning weed
To honour all their deaths who for her bleed."
"Come live with me, and be my love,
And we will some new pleasures prove
Of golden sands, and crystal brooks,
With silken lines, and silver hooks.

There will the river whispering run
Warm'd by thy eyes, more than the sun;
And there the 'enamour'd fish will stay,
Begging themselves they may betray.

When thou wilt swim in that live bath,
Each fish, which every channel hath,
Will amorously to thee swim,
Gladder to catch thee, than thou him.

If thou, to be so seen, be'st loth,
By sun or moon, thou dark'nest both,
And if myself have leave to see,
I need not their light having thee.

Let others freeze with angling reeds,
And cut their legs with shells and weeds,
Or treacherously poor fish beset,
With strangling snare, or windowy net.

Let coarse bold hands from slimy nest
The bedded fish in banks out-wrest;
Or curious traitors, sleeve-silk flies,
Bewitch poor fishes' wand'ring eyes.

For thee, thou need'st no such deceit,
For thou thyself art thine own bait:
That fish, that is not catch'd thereby,
Alas, is wiser far than I."
"Our storm is past, and that storm's tyrannous rage,
A stupid calm, but nothing it, doth 'suage.
The fable is inverted, and far more
A block afflicts, now, than a stork before.
Storms chafe, and soon wear out themselves, or us;
In calms, Heaven laughs to see us languish thus.
As steady'as I can wish that my thoughts were,
Smooth as thy mistress' glass, or what shines there,
The sea is now; and, as the isles which we
Seek, when we can move, our ships rooted be.
As water did in storms, now pitch runs out;
As lead, when a fir'd church becomes one spout.
And all our beauty, and our trim, decays,
Like courts removing, or like ended plays.
The fighting-place now seamen's rags supply;
And all the tackling is a frippery.
No use of lanthorns; and in one place lay
Feathers and dust, to-day and yesterday.
Earth's hollownesses, which the world's lungs are,
Have no more wind than the upper vault of air.
We can nor lost friends nor sought foes recover,
But meteor-like, save that we move not, hover.
Only the calenture together draws
Dear friends, which meet dead in great fishes' jaws;
And on the hatches, as on altars, lies
Each one, his own priest, and own sacrifice.
Who live, that miracle do multiply,
Where walkers in hot ovens do not die.
If in despite of these we swim, that hath
No more refreshing than our brimstone bath;
But from the sea into the ship we turn,
Like parboil'd wretches, on the coals to burn.
Like Bajazet encag'd, the shepherds' scoff,
Or like slack-sinew'd Samson, his hair off,
Languish our ships. Now as a myriad
Of ants durst th' emperor's lov'd snake invade,
The crawling gallies, sea-gaols, finny chips,
Might brave our pinnaces, now bed-rid ships.
Whether a rotten state, and hope of gain,
Or to disuse me from the queasy pain
Of being belov'd and loving, or the thirst
Of honour, or fair death, out-push'd me first,
I lose my end; for here, as well as I,
A desperate may live, and a coward die.
Stag, dog, and all which from or towards flies,
Is paid with life or prey, or doing dies.
Fate grudges us all, and doth subtly lay
A scourge, 'gainst which we all forget to pray.
He that at sea prays for more wind, as well
Under the poles may beg cold, heat in hell.
What are we then? How little more, alas,
Is man now, than before he was? He was
Nothing; for us, we are for nothing fit;
Chance, or ourselves, still disproportion it.
We have no power, no will, no sense; I lie,
I should not then thus feel this misery."
"Where, like a pillow on a bed
         A pregnant bank swell'd up to rest
The violet's reclining head,
         Sat we two, one another's best.
Our hands were firmly cemented
         With a fast balm, which thence did spring;
Our eye-beams twisted, and did thread
         Our eyes upon one double string;
So to'intergraft our hands, as yet
         Was all the means to make us one,
And pictures in our eyes to get
         Was all our propagation.
As 'twixt two equal armies fate
         Suspends uncertain victory,
Our souls (which to advance their state
         Were gone out) hung 'twixt her and me.
And whilst our souls negotiate there,
         We like sepulchral statues lay;
All day, the same our postures were,
         And we said nothing, all the day.
If any, so by love refin'd
         That he soul's language understood,
And by good love were grown all mind,
         Within convenient distance stood,
He (though he knew not which soul spake,
         Because both meant, both spake the same)
Might thence a new concoction take
         And part far purer than he came.
This ecstasy doth unperplex,
         We said, and tell us what we love;
We see by this it was not sex,
         We see we saw not what did move;
But as all several souls contain
         Mixture of things, they know not what,
Love these mix'd souls doth mix again
         And makes both one, each this and that.
A single violet transplant,
         The strength, the colour, and the size,
(All which before was poor and scant)
         Redoubles still, and multiplies.
When love with one another so
         Interinanimates two souls,
That abler soul, which thence doth flow,
         Defects of loneliness controls.
We then, who are this new soul, know
         Of what we are compos'd and made,
For th' atomies of which we grow
         Are souls, whom no change can invade.
But oh alas, so long, so far,
         Our bodies why do we forbear?
They'are ours, though they'are not we; we are
         The intelligences, they the spheres.
We owe them thanks, because they thus
         Did us, to us, at first convey,
Yielded their senses' force to us,
         Nor are dross to us, but allay.
On man heaven's influence works not so,
         But that it first imprints the air;
So soul into the soul may flow,
            Though it to body first repair.
As our blood labors to beget
         Spirits, as like souls as it can,
Because such fingers need to knit
         That subtle knot which makes us man,
So must pure lovers' souls descend
         T' affections, and to faculties,
Which sense may reach and apprehend,
         Else a great prince in prison lies.
To'our bodies turn we then, that so
         Weak men on love reveal'd may look;
Love's mysteries in souls do grow,
         But yet the body is his book.
And if some lover, such as we,
         Have heard this dialogue of one,
Let him still mark us, he shall see
         Small change, when we'are to bodies gone."
"No spring nor summer beauty hath such grace
         As I have seen in one autumnal face.
Young beauties force our love, and that's a rape,
         This doth but counsel, yet you cannot scape.
If 'twere a shame to love, here 'twere no shame;
         Affection here takes reverence's name.
Were her first years the golden age? That's true,
         But now she's gold oft tried and ever new.
That was her torrid and inflaming time,
         This is her tolerable tropic clime.
Fair eyes, who asks more heat than comes from hence,
         He in a fever wishes pestilence.
Call not these wrinkles, graves; if graves they were,
         They were Love's graves, for else he is no where.
Yet lies not Love dead here, but here doth sit
         Vow'd to this trench, like an anachorit;
And here till hers, which must be his death, come,
         He doth not dig a grave, but build a tomb.
Here dwells he; though he sojourn ev'rywhere
         In progress, yet his standing house is here:
Here where still evening is, not noon nor night,
         Where no voluptuousness, yet all delight.
In all her words, unto all hearers fit,
         You may at revels, you at council, sit.
This is Love's timber, youth his underwood;
         There he, as wine in June, enrages blood,
Which then comes seasonabliest when our taste
         And appetite to other things is past.
Xerxes' strange Lydian love, the platan tree,
         Was lov'd for age, none being so large as she,
Or else because, being young, nature did bless
         Her youth with age's glory, barrenness.
If we love things long sought, age is a thing
         Which we are fifty years in compassing;
If transitory things, which soon decay,
         Age must be loveliest at the latest day.
But name not winter faces, whose skin's slack,
         Lank as an unthrift's purse, but a soul's sack;
Whose eyes seek light within, for all here's shade;
         Whose mouths are holes, rather worn out than made;
Whose every tooth to a several place is gone,
         To vex their souls at resurrection:
Name not these living death's-heads unto me,
         For these, not ancient, but antique be.
I hate extremes, yet I had rather stay
         With tombs than cradles, to wear out a day.
Since such love's natural lation is, may still
         My love descend, and journey down the hill,
Not panting after growing beauties. So,
         I shall ebb on with them who homeward go."
"Here take my picture; though I bid farewell
Thine, in my heart, where my soul dwells, shall dwell.
'Tis like me now, but I dead, 'twill be more
When we are shadows both, than 'twas before.
When weather-beaten I come back, my hand
Perhaps with rude oars torn, or sun beams tann'd,
My face and breast of haircloth, and my head
With care's rash sudden storms being o'erspread,
My body'a sack of bones, broken within,
And powder's blue stains scatter'd on my skin;
If rival fools tax thee to'have lov'd a man
So foul and coarse as, oh, I may seem then,
This shall say what I was, and thou shalt say,
""Do his hurts reach me? doth my worth decay?
Or do they reach his judging mind, that he
Should now love less, what he did love to see?
That which in him was fair and delicate,
Was but the milk which in love's childish state
Did nurse it; who now is grown strong enough
To feed on that, which to disus'd tastes seems tough."""
"Thou hast made me, and shall thy work decay?
Repair me now, for now mine end doth haste,
I run to death, and death meets me as fast,
And all my pleasures are like yesterday;
I dare not move my dim eyes any way,
Despair behind, and death before doth cast
Such terror, and my feebled flesh doth waste
By sin in it, which it towards hell doth weigh.
Only thou art above, and when towards thee
By thy leave I can look, I rise again;
But our old subtle foe so tempteth me,
That not one hour I can myself sustain;
Thy grace may wing me to prevent his art,
And thou like adamant draw mine iron heart."
"Since I am coming to that holy room,
         Where, with thy choir of saints for evermore,
I shall be made thy music; as I come
         I tune the instrument here at the door,
         And what I must do then, think here before.

Whilst my physicians by their love are grown
         Cosmographers, and I their map, who lie
Flat on this bed, that by them may be shown
         That this is my south-west discovery,
      Per fretum febris, by these straits to die,

I joy, that in these straits I see my west;
         For, though their currents yield return to none,
What shall my west hurt me? As west and east
         In all flat maps (and I am one) are one,
         So death doth touch the resurrection.

Is the Pacific Sea my home? Or are
         The eastern riches? Is Jerusalem?
Anyan, and Magellan, and Gibraltar,
         All straits, and none but straits, are ways to them,
         Whether where Japhet dwelt, or Cham, or Shem.

We think that Paradise and Calvary,
         Christ's cross, and Adam's tree, stood in one place;
Look, Lord, and find both Adams met in me;
         As the first Adam's sweat surrounds my face,
         May the last Adam's blood my soul embrace.

So, in his purple wrapp'd, receive me, Lord;
         By these his thorns, give me his other crown;
And as to others' souls I preach'd thy word,
         Be this my text, my sermon to mine own:
""Therefore that he may raise, the Lord throws down."""
"My galley, charged with forgetfulness,
Thorough sharp seas in winter nights doth pass
'Tween rock and rock; and eke mine en'my, alas,
That is my lord, steereth with cruelness;
And every owre a thought in readiness,
As though that death were light in such a case.
An endless wind doth tear the sail apace
Of forced sighs and trusty fearfulness.
A rain of tears, a cloud of dark disdain,
Hath done the weared cords great hinderance;
Wreathed with error and eke with ignorance.
The stars be hid that led me to this pain;
Drowned is Reason that should me comfort,
And I remain despairing of the port."
"My mother's maids, when they did sew and spin,
They sang sometime a song of the field mouse,
That, for because her livelood was but thin,

Would needs go seek her townish sister's house.
She thought herself endured too much pain;
The stormy blasts her cave so sore did souse

That when the furrows swimmed with the rain,
She must lie cold and wet in sorry plight;
And worse than that, bare meat there did remain

To comfort her when she her house had dight;
Sometime a barley corn; sometime a bean;
For which she laboured hard both day and night

In harvest time whilst she might go and glean;
And where store was stroyed with the flood,
Then well away! for she undone was clean.

Then was she fain to take instead of food
Sleep, if she might, her hunger to beguile.
""My sister,"" quod she, ""hath a living good,

And hence from me she dwelleth not a mile.
In cold and storm she lieth warm and dry
In bed of down; the dirt doth not defile

Her tender foot, she laboureth not as I.
Richly she feedeth and at the richman's cost,
And for her meat she needs not crave nor cry.

By sea, by land, of the delicates, the most
Her cater seeks, and spareth for no peril.
She feedeth on boiled bacon meet and roast,

And hath thereof neither charge nor travail;
And when she list, the liquor of the grape
Doth glad her heart till that her belly swell.""

And at this journey she maketh but a jape;
So forth she goeth, trusting of all this wealth
With her sister her part so for to shape,

That if she might keep herself in health,
To live a lady while her life doth last.
And to the door now is she come by stealth,

And with her foot anon she scrapeth full fast.
Th' other for fear durst not well scarce appear,
Of every noise so was the wretch aghast.

At last she asked softly who was there.
And in her language, as well as she could,
""Peep!"" quod the other. ""Sister, I am here.""

""Peace,"" quod the towny mouse, ""why speakest thou so loud?""
And by the hand she took her fair and well.
""Welcome,"" quod she, ""my sister, by the Rood!""

She feasted her, that joy it was to tell
The fare they had; they drank the wine so clear,
And as to purpose now and then it fell,

She cheered her with ""How, sister, what cheer!""
Amids this joy befell a sorry chance,
That, well away! the stranger bought full dear

The fare she had, for, as she look askance,
Under a stool she spied two steaming eyes
In a round head with sharp ears. In France

Was never mouse so fear'd, for the unwise
Had not i-seen such a beast before,
Yet had nature taught her after her guise

To know her foe and dread him evermore.
The towny mouse fled, she know whither to go;
Th' other had no shift, but wonders sore

Feard of her life. At home she wished her tho,
And to the door, alas! as she did skip,
The Heaven it would, lo! and eke her chance was so,

At the threshold her silly foot did trip;
And ere she might recover it again,
The traitor cat had caught her by the hip,

And made her there against her will remain,
That had forgotten her poor surety and rest
For seeming wealth wherein she thought to reign.

Alas, my Poynz, how men do seek the best
And find the worst, by error as they stray!
And no marvail; when sight is so opprest.

And blind the guide; anon out of the way
Goeth guide and all in seeking quiet life.
O wretched minds, there is no gold that may

Grant that ye seek; no war, no peace, no strife.
No, no, although thy head were hooped with gold,
Sergeant with mace, hawbert, sword, nor knife,

Cannot repulse the care that follow should.
Each kind of life hath with him his disease.
Live in delight even as thy lust would,

And thou shalt find, when lust doth most thee please,
It irketh straight and by itself doth fade.
A small thing it is that may thy mind appease.

None of ye all there is that is so mad
To seek grapes upon brambles or breres;
Nor none, I trow, that hath his wit so bad

To set his hay for conies over rivers,
Ne ye set not a drag-net for an hare;
And yet the thing that most is your desire

Ye do mis-seek with more travail and care.
Make plain thine heart, that it be not knotted
With hope or dread, and see thy will be bare

From all affects, whom vice hath ever spotted.
Thyself content with that is thee assigned,
And use it well that is to thee allotted.

Then seek no more out of thyself to find
The thing that thou hast sought so long before,
For thou shalt feel it sitting in thy mind.

Mad, if ye list to continue your sore,
Let present pass and gape on time to come,
And deep yourself in travail more and more.

Henceforth, my Poynz, this shall be all and some,
These wretched fools shall have nought else of me;
But to the great God and to his high doom,

None other pain pray I for them to be,
But when the rage doth lead them from the right,
That, looking backward, Virtue they may see,

Even as she is, so goodly fair and bright;
And whilst they clasp their lusts in arms across,
Grant them, good Lord, as Thou mayst of Thy might
To fret inward for losing such a loss."
"Forget this rotten world, and unto thee
Let thine own times as an old story be.
Be not concern'd; study not why, nor when;
Do not so much as not believe a man.
For though to err, be worst, to try truths forth
Is far more business than this world is worth.
I'he world is but a carcass; thou art fed
By it, but as a worm, that carcass bred;
And why shouldst thou, poor worm, consider more,
When this world will grow better than before,
Than those thy fellow-worms do think upon
That carcass's last resurrection?
Forget this world, and scarce think of it so,
As of old clothes, cast off a year ago.
To be thus stupid is alacrity;
Men thus lethargic have best memory.
Look upward; that's towards her, whose happy state
We now lament not, but congratulate.
She, to whom all this world was but a stage,
Where all sat heark'ning how her youthful age
Should be employ'd, because in all she did
Some figure of the golden times was hid.
Who could not lack, what'er this world could give,
Because she was the form, that made it live;
Nor could complain that this world was unfit
To be stay'd in, then when she was in it;
She, that first tried indifferent desires
By virtue, and virtue by religious fires;
She, to whose person paradise adher'd,
As courts to princes; she, whose eyes enspher'd
Star-light enough t' have made the South control,
(Had she been there) the star-full Northern Pole;
She, she is gone; she is gone; when thou knowest this,
What fragmentary rubbish this world is
Thou knowest, and that it is not worth a thought;
He honours it too much that thinks it nought.
Think then, my soul, that death is but a groom,
Which brings a taper to the outward room,
Whence thou spiest first a little glimmering light,
And after brings it nearer to thy sight;
For such approaches doth heaven make in death.
Think thyself labouring now with broken breath,
And think those broken and soft notes to be
Division, and thy happiest harmony.
Think thee laid on thy death-bed, loose and slack,
And think that but unbinding of a pack,
To take one precious thing, thy soul, from thence.
Think thyself parch'd with fever's violence;
Anger thine ague more, by calling it
Thy physic; chide the slackness of the fit.
Think that thou hear'st thy knell, and think no more,
But that, as bells call'd thee to church before,
So this to the Triumphant Church calls thee.
Think Satan's sergeants round about thee be,
And think that but for legacies they thrust;
Give one thy pride, to'another give thy lust;
Give them those sins which they gave thee before,
And trust th' immaculate blood to wash thy score.
Think thy friends weeping round, and think that they
Weep but because they go not yet thy way.
Think that they close thine eyes, and think in this,
That they confess much in the world amiss,
Who dare not trust a dead man's eye with that
Which they from God and angels cover not.
Think that they shroud thee up, and think from thence
They reinvest thee in white innocence.
Think that thy body rots, and (if so low,
Thy soul exalted so, thy thoughts can go)
Think thee a prince, who of themselves create
Worms, which insensibly devour their state.
Think that they bury thee, and think that rite
Lays thee to sleep but a Saint Lucy's night."
"Come live with me and be my love,
And we will all the pleasures prove,
That Valleys, groves, hills, and fields,
Woods, or steepy mountain yields.

And we will sit upon the Rocks,
Seeing the Shepherds feed their flocks,
By shallow Rivers to whose falls
Melodious birds sing Madrigals.

And I will make thee beds of Roses
And a thousand fragrant posies,
A cap of flowers, and a kirtle
Embroidered all with leaves of Myrtle;

A gown made of the finest wool
Which from our pretty Lambs we pull;
Fair lined slippers for the cold,
With buckles of the purest gold;

A belt of straw and Ivy buds,
With Coral clasps and Amber studs:
And if these pleasures may thee move,
Come live with me, and be my love.

The Shepherds Swains shall dance and sing
For thy delight each May-morning:
If these delights thy mind may move,
Then live with me, and be my love."
"CALM was the day, and through the trembling air
Sweet breathing Zephyrus did softly play,
A gentle spirit, that lightly did delay
Hot Titan's beams, which then did glister fair;
When I whose sullen care,
Through discontent of my long fruitless stay
In prince's court, and expectation vain
Of idle hopes, which still do fly away
Like empty shadows, did afflict my brain,
Walked forth to ease my pain
Along the shore of silver streaming Thames,
Whose rutty bank, the which his river hems,
Was painted all with variable flowers,
And all the meads adorned with dainty gems,
Fit to deck maidens' bowers,
And crown their paramours,
Against the bridal day, which is not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

There, in a meadow, by the river's side,
A flock of nymphs I chanced to espy,
All lovely daughters of the flood thereby,
With goodly greenish locks, all loose untied,
As each had been a bride;
And each one had a little wicker basket,
Made of fine twigs, entrailed curiously,
In which they gathered flowers to fill their flasket,
And with fine fingers cropt full featously
The tender stalks on high.
Of every sort, which in that meadow grew,
They gathered some; the violet pallid blue,
The little daisy, that at evening closes,
The virgin lily, and the primrose true,
With store of vermeil roses,
To deck their bridegrooms' posies
Against the bridal day, which was not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

With that, I saw two swans of goodly hue
Come softly swimming down along the Lee;
Two fairer birds I yet did never see.
The snow which doth the top of Pindus strew,
Did never whiter shew,
Nor Jove himself, when he a swan would be
For love of Leda, whiter did appear:
Yet Leda was they say as white as he,
Yet not so white as these, nor nothing near.
So purely white they were,
That even the gentle stream, the which them bare,
Seemed foul to them, and bade his billows spare
To wet their silken feathers, lest they might
Soil their fair plumes with water not so fair,
And mar their beauties bright,
That shone as heaven's light,
Against their bridal day, which was not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

Eftsoons the nymphs, which now had flowers their fill,
Ran all in haste, to see that silver brood,
As they came floating on the crystal flood.
Whom when they saw, they stood amazed still,
Their wondering eyes to fill.
Them seemed they never saw a sight so fair,
Of fowls so lovely, that they sure did deem
Them heavenly born, or to be that same pair
Which through the sky draw Venus' silver team;
For sure they did not seem
To be begot of any earthly seed,
But rather angels, or of angels' breed:
Yet were they bred of Somers-heat they say,
In sweetest season, when each flower and weed
The earth did fresh array,
So fresh they seemed as day,
Even as their bridal day, which was not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

Then forth they all out of their baskets drew
Great store of flowers, the honour of the field,
That to the sense did fragrant odours yield,
All which upon those goodly birds they threw,
And all the waves did strew,
That like old Peneus' waters they did seem,
When down along by pleasant Tempe's shore,
Scattered with flowers, through Thessaly they stream,
That they appear through lilies' plenteous store,
Like a bride's chamber floor.
Two of those nymphs meanwhile, two garlands bound,
Of freshest flowers which in that mead they found,
The which presenting all in trim array,
Their snowy foreheads therewithal they crowned,
Whilst one did sing this lay,
Prepared against that day,
Against their bridal day, which was not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

'Ye gentle birds, the world's fair ornament,
And heaven's glory, whom this happy hour
Doth lead unto your lovers' blissful bower,
Joy may you have and gentle heart's content
Of your love's complement:
And let fair Venus, that is queen of love,
With her heart-quelling son upon you smile,
Whose smile, they say, hath virtue to remove
All love's dislike, and friendship's faulty guile
For ever to assoil.
Let endless peace your steadfast hearts accord,
And blessed plenty wait upon your board,
And let your bed with pleasures chaste abound,
That fruitful issue may to you afford,
Which may your foes confound,
And make your joys redound
Upon your bridal day, which is not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.'

So ended she; and all the rest around
To her redoubled that her undersong,
Which said their bridal day should not be long.
And gentle echo from the neighbour ground
Their accents did resound.
So forth those joyous birds did pass along,
Adown the Lee, that to them murmured low,
As he would speak, but that he lacked a tongue,
Yet did by signs his glad affection show,
Making his stream run slow.
And all the fowl which in his flood did dwell
Gan flock about these twain, that did excel
The rest so far as Cynthia doth shend
The lesser stars. So they, enranged well,
Did on those two attend,
And their best service lend,
Against their wedding day, which was not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

At length they all to merry London came,
To merry London, my most kindly nurse,
That to me gave this life's first native source;
Though from another place I take my name,
An house of ancient fame.
There when they came, whereas those bricky towers,
The which on Thames' broad aged back do ride,
Where now the studious lawyers have their bowers
There whilom wont the Templar Knights to bide,
Till they decayed through pride:
Next whereunto there stands a stately place,
Where oft I gained gifts and goodly grace
Of that great lord, which therein wont to dwell,
Whose want too well now feels my friendless case.
But ah, here fits not well
Old woes but joys to tell
Against the bridal day, which is not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

Yet therein now doth lodge a noble peer,
Great England's glory, and the world's wide wonder,
Whose dreadful name late through all Spain did thunder,
And Hercules' two pillars standing near
Did make to quake and fear:
Fair branch of honour, flower of chivalry,
That fillest England with thy triumph's fame,
Joy have thou of thy noble victory,
And endless happiness of thine own name
That promiseth the same:
That through thy prowess and victorious arms,
Thy country may be freed from foreign harms;
And great Elisa's glorious name may ring
Through all the world, filled with thy wide alarms,
Which some brave Muse may sing
To ages following,
Upon the bridal day, which is not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.

From those high towers this noble lord issuing,
Like radiant Hesper when his golden hair
In th'Ocean billows he hath bathed fair,
Descended to the river's open viewing,
With a great train ensuing.
Above the rest were goodly to be seen
Two gentle knights of lovely face and feature
Beseeming well the bower of any queen,
With gifts of wit and ornaments of nature,
Fit for so goodly stature;
That like the twins of Jove they seemed in sight,
Which deck the baldric of the heavens bright.
They two forth pacing to the river's side,
Received those two fair birds, their love's delight;
Which, at th' appointed tide,
Each one did make his bride
Against their bridal day, which is not long:
      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song."
"THENOT    &      HOBBINOLL
Tell me good Hobbinoll, what garres thee greete?
What? hath some Wolfe thy tender Lambes ytorne?
Or is thy Bagpype broke, that soundes so sweete?
Or art thou of thy loved lasse forlorne?

Or bene thine eyes attempred to the yeare,
Quenching the gasping furrowes thirst with rayne?
Like April shoure, so stremes the trickling teares
Adowne thy cheeke, to quenche thy thristye payne.

HOBBINOLL
Nor thys, nor that, so muche doeth make me mourne,
But for the ladde, whome long I lovd so deare,
Nowe loves a lasse, that all his love doth scorne:
He plongd in payne, his tressed locks dooth teare.

Shepheards delights he dooth them all forsweare,
Hys pleasaunt Pipe, whych made us meriment,
He wylfully hath broke, and doth forbeare
His wonted songs, wherein he all outwent.

THENOT
What is he for a Ladde, you so lament?
Ys love such pinching payne to them, that prove?
And hath he skill to make so excellent,
Yet hath so little skill to brydle love?

HOBBINOLL
Colin thou kenst, the Southerne shepheardes boye:
Him Love hath wounded with a deadly darte.
Whilome on him was all my care and joye,
Forcing with gyfts to winne his wanton heart.

But now from me hys madding mynd is starte,
And woes the Widdowes daughter of the glenne:
So nowe fayre Rosalind hath bredde hys smart,
So now his frend is chaunged for a frenne.

THENOT
But if hys ditties bene so trimly dight,
I pray thee Hobbinoll, recorde some one:
The whiles our flockes doe graze about in sight,
And we close shrowded in thys shade alone.

HOBBINOLL
Contented I: then will I singe his laye
Of fayre Elisa, Queene of shepheardes all:
Which once he made, as by a spring he laye,
And tuned it unto the Waters fall.

Ye dayntye Nymphs, that in this blessed Brooke
         doe bathe your brest,
Forsake your watry bowres, and hether looke,
         at my request:
And eke you Virgins, that on Parnasse dwell,
Whence floweth Helicon the learned well,
         Helpe me to blaze
         Her worthy praise,
Which in her sexe doth all excell.

Of fayre Eliza be your silver song,
         that blessed wight:
The flowre of Virgins, may shee florish long,
         In princely plight.
For shee is Syrinx daughter without spotte,
Which Pan the shepheards God of her begot:
         So sprong her grace
         Of heavenly race,
No mortall blemishe may her blotte.

See, where she sits upon the grassie greene,
         (O seemely sight)
Yclad in Scarlot like a mayden Queene,
         And Ermines white.
Upon her head a Cremosin coronet,
With Damaske roses and Daffadillies set:
         Bayleaves betweene,
         And Primroses greene
Embellish the sweete Violet.

Tell me, have ye seene her angelick face,
         Like Ph{oe}be fayre?
Her heavenly haveour, her princely grace
         can you well compare?
The Redde rose medled with the White yfere,
In either cheeke depeincten lively chere.
         Her modest eye,
         Her Majestie,
Where have you seene the like, but there?

I sawe Ph{oe}bus thrust out his golden hedde,
         upon her to gaze:
But when he sawe, how broade her beames did spredde,
         it did him amaze.
He blusht to see another Sunne belowe,
Ne durst againe his fyrye face out showe:
         Let him, if he dare,
         His brightnesse compare
With hers, to have the overthrowe.

Shewe thy selfe Cynthia with thy silver rayes,
         and be not abasht:
When shee the beames of her beauty displayes,
         O how art thou dasht?
But I will not match her with Latonaes seede,
Such follie great sorow to Niobe did breede.
         Now she is a stone,
         And makes dayly mone,
Warning all other to take heede.

Pan may be proud, that ever he begot
         such a Bellibone,
And Syrinx rejoyse, that ever was her lot
         to beare such an one.
Soone as my younglings cryen for the dam,
To her will I offer a milkwhite Lamb:
         Shee is my goddesse plaine,
         And I her shepherds swayne,
Albee forswonck and forswatt I am.

I see Calliope speede her to the place,
         where my Goddesse shines:
And after her the other Muses trace,
         with their Violines.
Bene they not Bay braunches, which they doe beare,
All for Elisa in her hand to weare?
         So sweetely they play,
         And sing all the way,
That it a heaven is to heare.

Lo how finely the graces can it foote
         to the Instrument:
They dauncen deffly, and singen soote,
         in their meriment.
Wants not a fourth grace, to make the daunce even?
Let that rowme to my Lady be yeven:
         She shalbe a grace,
         To fyll the fourth place,
And reigne with the rest in heaven.

And whither rennes this bevie of Ladies bright,
         raunged in a rowe?
They bene all Ladyes of the lake behight,
         that unto her goe.
Chloris, that is the chiefest Nymph of al,
Of Olive braunches beares a Coronall:
         Olives bene for peace,
         When wars doe surcease:
Such for a Princesse bene principall.

Ye shepheards daughters, that dwell on the greene,
         hye you there apace:
Let none come there, but that Virgins bene,
         to adorne her grace.
And when you come, whereas shee is in place,
See, that your rudeness doe not you disgrace:
         Binde your fillets faste,
         And gird in your waste,
For more finesse, with a tawdrie lace.

Bring hether the Pincke and purple Cullambine,
         With Gelliflowres:
Bring Coronations, and Sops in wine,
         worne of Paramoures.
Strowe me the ground with Daffadowndillies,
And Cowslips, and Kingcups, and loved Lillies:
         The pretie Pawnce,
         And the Chevisaunce,
Shall match with the fayre flowre Delice.

Now ryse up Elisa, decked as thou art,
         in royall aray:
And now ye daintie Damsells may depart
         echeone her way,
I feare, I have troubled your troupes to longe:
Let dame Eliza thanke you for her song.
         And if you come hether,
         When Damsines I gether,
I will part them all you among.

THENOT
And was thilk same song of Colins owne making?
Ah foolish boy, that is with love yblent:
Great pittie is, he be in such taking,
For naught caren, that bene so lewdly bent.

HOBBINOLL
Sicker I hold him, for a greater fon,
That loves the thing, he cannot purchase.
But let us homeward: for night draweth on,
And twincling starres the daylight hence chase.

"PIERCE       &         CUDDIE
Cuddie, for shame hold up thy heavye head,
And let us cast with what delight to chace,
And weary thys long lingring Phoebus race.
Whilome thou wont the shepheards laddes to leade,
In rymes, in ridles, and in bydding base:
Now they in thee, and thou in sleepe art dead.

CUDDY
Piers, I have pyped erst so long with payne,
That all mine Oten reedes bene rent and wore:
And my poore Muse hath spent her spared store,
Yet little good hath got, and much lesse gayne,
Such pleasaunce makes the Grashopper so poore,
And ligge so layd, when Winter doth her straine.

The dapper ditties, that I wont devise,
To feede youthes fancie, and the flocking fry,
Delighten much: what I the bett for thy?
They han the pleasure, I a sclender prise.
I beate the bush, the byrds to them doe flye:
What good thereof to Cuddie can arise?

PIERS
Cuddie, the prayse is better, then the price,
The glory eke much greater then the gayne:
O what an honor is it, to restraine
The lust of lawlesse youth with good advice:
Or pricke them forth with pleasaunce of thy vaine,
Whereto thou list their trayned willes entice.

Soone as thou gynst to sette thy notes in frame,
O how the rurall routes to thee doe cleave:
Seemeth thou dost their soule of sence bereave,
All as the shepheard, that did fetch his dame
From Plutoes balefull bowre withouten leave:
His musicks might the hellish hound did tame.

CUDDIE
So praysen babes the Peacoks spotted traine,
And wondren at bright Argus blazing eye:
But who rewards him ere the more for thy?
Or feedes him once the fuller by a graine?
Sike prayse is smoke, that sheddeth in the skye,
Sike words bene wynd, and wasten soone in vayne.

PIERS
Abandon then the base and viler clowne,
Lyft up thy selfe out of the lowly dust:
And sing of bloody Mars, of wars, of giusts.
Turne thee to those, that weld the awful crowne,
To doubted Knights, whose woundlesse armour rusts,
And helmes unbruzed wexen dayly browne.

There may thy Muse display her fluttryng wing,
And stretch her selfe at large from East to West:
Whither thou list in fayre Elisa rest,
Or if thee please in bigger notes to sing,
Advaunce the worthy whome shee loveth best,
That first the white beare to the stake did bring.

And when the stubborne stroke of stronger stounds,
Has somewhat slackt the tenor of thy string:
Of love and lustihed tho mayst thou sing,
And carrol lowde, and leade the Myllers rownde,
All were Elisa one of thilke same ring.
So mought our Cuddies name to Heaven sownde.

CUDDYE
Indeed the Romish Tityrus, I heare,
Through his Mecoenas left his Oaten reede,
Whereon he earst had taught his flocks to feede,
And laboured lands to yield the timely eare,
And eft did sing of warres and deadly drede,
So as the Heavens did quake his verse to here.

But ah Mecoenas is yclad in claye,
And great Augustus long ygoe is dead:
And all the worthies liggen wrapt in leade,
That matter made for Poets on to play:
For ever, who in derring doe were dreade,
The loftie verse of hem was loved aye.

But after vertue gan for age to stoupe,
And mighty manhode brought a bedde of ease:
The vaunting Poets found nought worth a pease,
To put in preace emong the learned troupe.
Tho gan the streames of flowing wittes to cease,
And sonnebright honour pend in shamefull coupe.

And if that any buddes of Poesie,
Yet of the old stocke gan to shoote agayne:
Or it mens follies mote be forst to fayne,
And rolle with rest in rymes of rybaudrye:
Or as it sprong, it wither must agayne:
Tom Piper makes us better melodie.

PIERS
O pierlesse Poesye, where is then thy place?
If nor in Princes pallace thou doe sitt:
(And yet is Princes pallace the most fitt)
Ne brest of baser birth doth thee embrace.
Then make thee winges of thine aspyring wit,
And, whence thou camst, flye backe to heaven apace.

CUDDIE
Ah Percy it is all to weake and wanne,
So high to sore, and make so large a flight:
Her peeced pyneons bene not so in plight,
For Colin fittes such famous flight to scanne:
He, were he not with love so ill bedight,
Would mount as high, and sing as soote as Swanne.

PIERS
Ah fon, for love does teach him climbe so hie,
And lyftes him up out of the loathsome myre:
Such immortall mirrhor, as he doth admire,
Would rayse ones mynd above the starry skie.
And cause a caytive corage to aspire,
For lofty love doth loath a lowly eye.

CUDDIE
All otherwise the state of Poet stands,
For lordly love is such a Tyranne fell:
That where he rules, all power he doth expell.
The vaunted verse a vacant head demaundes,
Ne wont with crabbed care the Muses dwell.
Unwisely weaves, that takes two webbes in hand.

Who ever casts to compasse weightye prise,
And thinks to throwe out thondring words of threate:
Let powre in lavish cups and thriftie bitts of meate,
For Bacchus fruite is frend to Phoebus wise.
And when with Wine the braine begins to sweate,
The nombers flowe as fast as spring doth ryse.

Thou kenst not Percie howe the ryme should rage.
O if my temples were distaind with wine,
And girt in girlonds of wild Yvie twine,
How I could reare the Muse on stately stage,
And teache her tread aloft in buskin fine,
With queint Bellona in her equipage.

But ah my corage cooles ere it be warme,
For thy, content us in thys humble shade:
Where no such troublous tydes han us assayde,
Here we our slender pipes may safely charme.

PIERS
And when my Gates shall han their bellies layd:
Cuddie shall have a Kidde to store his farme.

"Full fathom five thy father lies;
Of his bones are coral made;
Those are pearls that were his eyes:
Nothing of him that doth fade,
But doth suffer a sea-change
Into something rich and strange.
Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell:
                                             Ding-dong.
Hark! now I hear them,ding-dong, bell."
"Hark, hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings, 
And Phoebus 'gins arise, 
His steeds to water at those springs 
On chaliced flowers that lies; 
And winking Mary-buds begin 
To ope their golden eyes: 
With every thing that pretty is, 
My lady sweet, arise: 
Arise, arise."
"Notes:
Macbeth: IV.i 10-19; 35-38"
"Orpheus with his lute made trees, 
And the mountain tops that freeze, 
Bow themselves when he did sing:
To his music plants and flowers 
Ever sprung; as sun and showers 
There had made a lasting spring. 
Every thing that heard him play, 
Even the billows of the sea, 
Hung their heads, and then lay by. 
In sweet music is such art, 
Killing care and grief of heart 
Fall asleep, or hearing, die."
"Under the greenwood tree
Who loves to lie with me,
And turn his merry note
Unto the sweet bird's throat,
Come hither, come hither, come hither:
            Here shall he see
            No enemy
But winter and rough weather.

Who doth ambition shun
And loves to live i' the sun,
Seeking the food he eats,
And pleased with what he gets,
Come hither, come hither, come hither:
            Here shall he see
            No enemy
But winter and rough weather."
"Full many a glorious morning have I seen
Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,
Kissing with golden face the meadows green,
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
With ugly rack on his celestial face
And from the forlorn world his visage hide,
Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace.
Even so my sun one early morn did shine
With all-triumphant splendour on my brow;
But out, alack! he was but one hour mine;
The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.
Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;
Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth."
"That time of year thou mayst in me behold
When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.
In me thou see'st the twilight of such day
As after sunset fadeth in the west,
Which by and by black night doth take away,
Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.
In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
As the death-bed whereon it must expire,
Consum'd with that which it was nourish'd by.
This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,
To love that well which thou must leave ere long."
"How like a winter hath my absence been
From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!
What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!
What old December's bareness everywhere!
And yet this time remov'd was summer's time,
The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,
Bearing the wanton burthen of the prime,
Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:
Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me
But hope of orphans and unfather'd fruit;
For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,
And thou away, the very birds are mute;
Or if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer
That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near."
"Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,
[......] these rebel powers that thee array,
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?
Why so large cost, having so short a lease,
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?
Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,
Eat up thy charge? Is this thy body's end?
Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss
And let that pine to aggravate thy store;
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;
Within be fed, without be rich no more.
So shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,
And, Death once dead, there's no more dying then."
"Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,
And make me travel forth without my cloak,
To let base clouds oertake me in my way,
Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?
Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,
To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,
For no man well of such a salve can speak
That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace:
Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;
Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:
The offenders sorrow lends but weak relief
To him that bears the strong offences cross.
   Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,
   And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.
 
 
 "
"Weret aught to me I bore the canopy,
With my extern the outward honouring,
Or laid great bases for eternity,
Which proves more short than waste or ruining;
Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour
Lose all, and more, by paying too much rent,
For compound sweet forgoing simple savour,
Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?
No;let me be obsequious in thy heart,
And take thou my oblation, poor but free,
Which is not mixd with seconds, knows no art,
But mutual render, only me for thee.
   Hence, thou subornd informer! a true soul,
   When most impeachd, stands least in thy control. 
 "
"Let the bird of loudest lay
On the sole Arabian tree
Herald sad and trumpet be,
To whose sound chaste wings obey.

But thou shrieking harbinger,
Foul precurrer of the fiend,
Augur of the fever's end,
To this troop come thou not near.

From this session interdict
Every fowl of tyrant wing,
Save the eagle, feather'd king;
Keep the obsequy so strict.

Let the priest in surplice white,
That defunctive music can,
Be the death-divining swan,
Lest the requiem lack his right.

And thou treble-dated crow,
That thy sable gender mak'st
With the breath thou giv'st and tak'st,
'Mongst our mourners shalt thou go.

Here the anthem doth commence:
Love and constancy is dead;
Phoenix and the Turtle fled
In a mutual flame from hence.

So they lov'd, as love in twain
Had the essence but in one;
Two distincts, division none:
Number there in love was slain.

Hearts remote, yet not asunder;
Distance and no space was seen
'Twixt this Turtle and his queen:
But in them it were a wonder.

So between them love did shine
That the Turtle saw his right
Flaming in the Phoenix' sight:
Either was the other's mine.

Property was thus appalled
That the self was not the same;
Single nature's double name
Neither two nor one was called.

Reason, in itself confounded,
Saw division grow together,
To themselves yet either neither,
Simple were so well compounded;

That it cried, ""How true a twain
Seemeth this concordant one!
Love has reason, reason none,
If what parts can so remain.""

Whereupon it made this threne
To the Phoenix and the Dove,
Co-supremes and stars of love,
As chorus to their tragic scene:

                 threnos

Beauty, truth, and rarity,
Grace in all simplicity,
Here enclos'd, in cinders lie.

Death is now the Phoenix' nest,
And the Turtle's loyal breast
To eternity doth rest,

Leaving no posterity:
'Twas not their infirmity,
It was married chastity.

Truth may seem but cannot be;
Beauty brag but 'tis not she;
Truth and beauty buried be.

To this urn let those repair
That are either true or fair;
For these dead birds sigh a prayer."
"     Sing lullaby, as women do,
Wherewith they bring their babes to rest,
And lullaby can I sing too
As womanly as can the best.
With lullaby they still the child,
And if I be not much beguiled,
Full many wanton babes have I
Which must be stilled with lullaby.

     First lullaby my youthful years;
It is now time to go to bed,
For crooked age and hoary hairs
Have won the haven within my head.
With lullaby, then, youth be still;
With lullaby content thy will;
Since courage quails and comes behind,
Go sleep, and so beguile thy mind.

     Next, lullaby my gazing eyes,
Which wonted were to glance apace.
For every glass may now suffice
To show the furrows in my face;
With lullaby then wink awhile,
With lullaby your looks beguile;
Let no fair face nor beauty bright
Entice you eft with vain delight.

     And lullaby, my wanton will;
Let reason's rule now reign thy thought,
Since all too late I find by skill
How dear I have thy fancies bought;
With lullaby now take thine ease,
With lullaby thy doubts appease.
For trust to this: if thou be still,
My body shall obey thy will.

     Eke lullaby, my loving boy,
My little Robin, take thy rest;
Since age is cold and nothing coy,
Keep close thy coin, for so is best;
With lullaby be thou content,
With lullaby thy lusts relent,
Let others pay which hath mo pence;
Thou art too poor for such expense.

     Thus lullaby, my youth, mine eyes,
My will, my ware, and all that was.
I can no mo delays devise,
But welcome pain, let pleasure pass;
With lullaby now take your leave,
With lullaby your dreams deceive;
And when you rise with waking eye,
Remember then this lullaby."
"Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me:
Ist not enough to torture me alone,
But slave to slavery my sweetst friend must be?
Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,
And my next self thou harder hast engrossed;
Of him, myself, and thee I am forsaken,
A torment thrice threefold thus to be crossed.
Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,
But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;
Whoeer keeps me, let my heart be his guard:
Thou canst not then use rigour in my jail.
    And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,
    Perforce am thine, and all that is in me."
"O, call not me to justify the wrong
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;
Use power with power, and slay me not by art.
Tell me thou lovst elsewhere; but in my sight,
Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside;
What needst thou wound with cunning when thy might
Is more than my oerpressed defense can bide?
Let me excuse thee: ah, my love well knows
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies;
And therefore from my face she turns my foes,
That they elsewhere might dart their injuries
    Yet do not so; but since I am near slain,
    Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain."
"Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving.
O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;
Or if it do, not from those lips of thine,
That have profaned their scarlet ornaments
And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,
Robbed others beds revenues of their rents.
Be it lawful I love thee as thou lovst those
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:
Root pity in thy heart, that, when it grows,
Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.
    If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,
    By self-example mayst thou be denied."
"My love is as a fever, longing still
For that which longer nurseth the disease,
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
Th uncertain sickly appetite to please.
My reason, the physician to my love,
Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,
Hath left me, and I desperate now approve
Desire is death, which physic did except.
Past cure I am, now reason is past care,
And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;
My thoughts and my discourse as madmens are,
At random from the truth vainly expressed:
    For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,
    Who art as black as hell, as dark as night."
"A Poet am I neither born nor bred,
But to a witty poet married:
Whose brain is fresh and pleasant as the Spring,
Where Fancies grow and where the Muses sing.
There oft I lean my head, and listening, hark,
To catch his words and all his fancies mark:
And from that garden show of beauties take
Whereof a posy I in verse may make.
Thus I, that have no gardens of my own,
There gather flowers that are newly blown."
"Loving in truth, and fain in verse my love to show,
That she, dear she, might take some pleasure of my pain,
Pleasure might cause her read, reading might make her know,
Knowledge might pity win, and pity grace obtain,
I sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe,
Studying inventions fine, her wits to entertain,
Oft turning others leaves, to see if thence would flow
Some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sunburned brain.
But words came halting forth, wanting Inventions stay:
Invention, Natures child, fled step-dame Studys blows,
And others feet still seemed but strangers in my way.
Thus great with child to speak, and helpless in my throes,
Biting my truant pen, beating myself for spite:
Fool, said my Muse to me, look in thy heart and write."
"Misus and Mopsa hardly could agree,
Striving about superiority.
The text which says that man and wife are one,
Was the chief argument they stood upon. 
She held they both one woman should become,
He held both should be man, and both but one.
     So they contended daily, but the strife
     Could not be ended, till both were one wife."
"Joy of my life, full oft for loving you
    I bless my lot, that was so lucky placed:
    But then the more your own mishap I rue,
    That are so much by so mean love embased.
For had the equal heavens so much you graced
    In this as in the rest, ye might invent
    Some heavenly wit, whose verse could have enchased
    Your glorious name in golden monument.
But since ye deignd so goodly to relent
    To me your thrall, in whom is little worth,
    That little that I am shall all be spent
    In setting your immortal praises forth;
Whose lofty argument uplifting me
    Shall lift you up unto an high degree."
"Sweet shades why doe you seeke to give delight
    To mee who deeme delight in this vilde place
    Butt torment, sorrow, and mine owne disgrace
    To taste of joy, or your vaine pleasing sight;

Show them your pleasures who saw never night
    Of greife, wher joyings fauning, smiling face
    Appeers as day, wher griefe found never space
    Yett for a sigh, a grone, or envies spite;

Butt O on mee a world of woes doe ly,
    Or els on mee all harmes strive to rely,
    And to attend like servants bound to mee,

Heat in desire, while frosts of care I prove,
    Wanting my love, yett surfett doe with love
    Burne, and yett freeze, better in hell to bee."
"Come darkest night, becoming sorrow best;
    Light; leave thy light; fitt for a lightsome soule;
    Darknes doth truly sure with mee oprest
    Whom absence power doth from mirthe controle:

The very trees with hanging heads condole
    Sweet sommers parting, and of leaves distrest
    In dying coulers make a griefe-full role;
    Soe much (alas) to sorrow are they prest,

Thus of dead leaves her farewell carpetts made:
    Theyr fall, theyr branches, all theyr mournings prove;
    With leavles, naked bodies, whose huese vade
    From hopefull greene, to wither in theyr love,

If trees, and leaves for absence, mourners bee
Noe mervaile that I grieve, who like want see."
"Love like a jugler, comes to play his prise,
    And all minds draw his wonders to admire,
    To see how cuningly hee, wanting eyes,
    Can yett deseave the best sight of desire:

 The wanton child, how hee can faine his fire
    So pretely, as none sees his disguise!
    How finely doe his tricks, while wee fooles hire
    The badge, and office of his tirannies,

For in the end, such jugling hee doth make
    As hee our harts, in stead of eyes doth take
    For men can only by theyr slieghts abuse

The sight with nimble, and delightful skill;
    Butt if hee play, his gaine is our lost will:
    Yett childlike, wee can nott his sports refuse."
"Time only cause of my unrest
By whom I hopd once to bee blest
    How cruell art thou turned?
That first gavst lyfe unto my love,
And still a pleasure nott to move
    Or change though ever burned;

Have I thee slackd, or left undun
One loving rite, and soe have wunn
    Thy rage or bitter changing?
That now noe minutes I shall see,
Wherein I may least happy bee
    Thy favors soe estranging.

Blame thy self, and nott my folly,
Time gave time butt to bee holly;
    True love such ends best loveth
Unworhty love doth seeke for ends
A worthy love butt worth pretends
    Nor other thoughts itt proveth:

Then stay thy swiftnes cruell time,
And lett mee once more blessed clime
    To joy, that I may prayse thee:
Lett mee pleasure sweetly tasting
Joy in love, and faith nott wasting
    And on fames wings Ile rayse thee:

Never shall thy glory dying
Bee untill thine owne untying
    That time noe longer liveth;
Tis a gaine such tyme to lend:
Since soe thy fame shall never end
    Butt joy for what she giveth."
"Love peruse me, seeke, and finde
How each corner of my minde
            Is a twine
            Woven to shine.
Not a Webb ill made, foule framd,
Bastard not by Father namd,
            Such in me
            Cannot bee.
Deare behold me, you shall see
Faith the Hive, and love the Bee,
            Which doe bring.
            Gaine and sting.
Pray desect me, sinewes, vaines,
Hold, and loves life in those gaines;
            Lying bare
            To despaire,
When you thus anotamise
All my body, my heart prise;
            Being true
            Just to you.
Close the Truncke, embalme the Chest,
Where your power still shall rest,
            Joy entombe,
            Loves just doome."
"When I beeheld the Image of my deere
    With greedy lookes mine eyes would that way bend,
    Fear, and desire did inwardly contend;
    Feare to bee markd, desire to drawe still neere,

And in my soule a speritt wowld apeer,
    Which boldnes waranted, and did pretend
    To bee my genius, yett I durst nott lend
    My eyes in trust wher others seemed soe cleere,

Then did I search from whence this danger rose,
    If such unworthynes in mee did rest
    As my stervd eyes must nott with sight bee blest;
    When jealousie her poyson did disclose;

Yett in my hart unseense of jealous eye
The truer Image shall in triumph lye."
"Love leave to urge, thou knowst thou hast the hand;
    Tis cowardise, to strive wher none resist:
    Pray thee leave off, I yeeld unto thy band;
    Doe nott thus, still, in thine owne powre persist,

Beehold I yeeld: lett forces bee dismist;
    I ame thy subject, conquerd, bound to stand,
    Never thy foe, butt did thy claime assist
    Seeking thy due of those who did withstand;

Butt now, itt seemes, thou wouldst I should thee love;
    I doe confess, twas thy will made mee chuse;
    And thy faire showes made mee a lover prove
    When I my freedome did, for paine refuse.

Yett this Sir God, your boyship I dispise;
Your charmes I obay, butt love nott want of eyes."
"Long have I longd to see my love againe,
Still have I wisht, but never could obtaine it;
Rather than all the world (if I might gaine it)
Would I desire my loves sweet precious gaine.
Yet in my soule I see him everie day,
See him, and see his still sterne countenaunce,
But (ah) what is of long continuance,
Where majestie and beautie beares the sway?
Sometimes, when I imagine that I see him,
(As love is full of foolish fantasies)
Weening to kisse his lips, as my loves fees,
I feele but aire: nothing but aire to bee him.
Thus with Ixion, kisse I clouds in vaine:
Thus with Ixion, feele I endles paine."
"Cherry-lipt Adonis in his snowie shape,
    Might not compare with his pure ivorie white,
    On whose faire front a poets pen may write,
Whose roseate red excels the crimson grape,
His love-enticing delicate soft limbs,
    Are rarely framd tintrap poore gazine eies:
    His cheeks, the lillie and carnation dies,
With lovely tincture which Apollos dims.
His lips ripe strawberries in nectar wet,
    His mouth a Hive, his tongue a hony-combe,
    Where Muses (like bees) make their mansion.
His teeth pure pearle in blushing correll set.
    Oh how can such a body sinne-procuring,
    Be slow to love, and quicke to hate, enduring?"
"They flee from me, that sometime did me seek
    With naked foot, stalking in my chamber.
I have seen them gentle, tame, and meek,
    That now are wild, and do not remember
    That sometime they put themselves in danger
         To take bread at my hand; and now they range
         Busily seeking with a continual change.

Thanked be fortune it hath been otherwise
    Twenty times better; but once, in special,
In thin array, after a pleasant guise,
    When her loose gown from her shoulders did fall,
    And she me caught in her arms long and small;
         Therewith all sweetly did me kiss,
         And softly said, Dear heart, how like you this?

It was no dream: I lay broad waking:
    But all is turned, thorough my gentleness,
Into a strange fashion of forsaking;
    And I have leave to go of her goodness,
    And she also to use newfangleness.
         But since that I so kindly am served,
         I would fain know what she hath deserved."
"Tis true, tis day, what though it be?
O wilt thou therefore rise from me?
Why should we rise because tis light?
Did we lie down because twas night?
Love, which in spite of darkness brought us hither,
Should in despite of light keep us together.

Light hath no tongue, but is all eye;
If it could speak as well as spy,
This were the worst that it could say,
That being well I fain would stay,
And that I loved my heart and honour so,
That I would not from him, that had them, go.

Must business thee from hence remove?
Oh, thats the worst disease of love,
The poor, the foul, the false, love can
Admit, but not the busied man.
He which hath business, and makes love, doth do
Such wrong, as when a married man doth woo."
"I loathe that I did love,
In youth that I thought sweet,
As time requires for my behove,
Methinks they are not meet.

My lusts they do me leave,
My fancies all be fled,
And tract of time begins to weave
Grey hairs upon my head,

For age with stealing steps
Hath clawed me with his crutch,
And lusty life away she leaps
As there had been none such.

My Muse doth not delight
Me as she did before;
My hand and pen are not in plight,
As they have been of yore.

For reason me denies
This youthly idle rhyme;
And day by day to me she cries,
Leave off these toys in time.

The wrinkles in my brow,
The furrows in my face,
Say, limping age will lodge him now
Where youth must give him place.

The harbinger of death,
To me I see him ride,
The cough, the cold, the gasping breath
Doth bid me provide

A pickaxe and a spade,
And eke a shrouding sheet,
A house of clay for to be made
For such a guest most meet.

Methinks I hear the clark
That knolls the careful knell,
And bids me leave my woeful wark,
Ere nature me compel.

My keepers knit the knot
That youth did laugh to scorn,
Of me that clean shall be forgot
As I had not been born.

Thus must I youth give up,
Whose badge I long did wear;
To them I yield the wanton cup
That better may it bear.

Lo, here the bared skull,
By whose bald sign I know
That stooping age away shall pull
Which youthful years did sow.

For beauty with her band
These crooked cares hath wrought,
And shipped me into the land
From whence I first was brought.

And ye that bide behind,
Have ye none other trust:
As ye of clay were cast by kind,
So shall ye waste to dust."
"Alas, so all things now do hold their peace!
   Heaven and earth disturbed in no thing;
The beasts, the air, the birds their song do cease,
   The nightes car the stars about doth bring;
Calm is the sea; the waves work less and less:
   So am not I, whom love, alas! doth wring,
Bringing before my face the great increase
   Of my desires, whereat I weep and sing,
In joy and woe, as in a doubtful case.
   For my sweet thoughts sometime do pleasure bring:
But by and by, the cause of my disease
   Gives me a pang that inwardly doth sting,
When that I think what grief it is again
To live and lack the thing should rid my pain.   "
"Happy ye leaves when as those lilly hands,
Which hold my life in their dead doing might
Shall handle you and hold in loves soft bands,
Lyke captives trembling at the victors sight.
And happy lines, on which with starry light,
Those lamping eyes will deigne sometimes to look
And reade the sorrowes of my dying spright,
Written with teares in harts close bleeding book.
And happy rymes bathd in the sacred brooke,
Of Helicon whence she derived is,
When ye behold that Angels blessed looke,
My soules long lacked foode, my heavens blis.
Leaves, lines, and rymes, seeke her to please alone,
Whom if ye please, I care for other none. 


 "
"New yeare forth looking out of Janus gate,
Doth seeme to promise hope of new delight:
And bidding thold Adieu, his pass"
"Of this worlds Theatre in which we stay,
My love lyke the Spectator ydly sits
Beholding me that all the pageants play,
Disguysing diversly my troubled wits.
Sometimes I joy when glad occasion fits,
And mask in myrth lyke to a Comedy:
Soone after when my joy to sorrow flits,
I waile and make my woes a Tragedy.
Yet she beholding me with constant eye,
Delights not in my merth nor rues my smart:
But when I laugh she mocks, and when I cry
She laughes, and hardens evermore her hart.
What then can move her? if not merth nor mone,
She is no woman, but a sencelesse stone."
"So oft as I her beauty do behold,
And therewith do her cruelty compare,
I marvel of what substance was the mould
The which her made at once so cruel-fair.
Not earth; for her high thoughts more heavenly are:
Not water; for her love doth burn like fire:
Not air; for she is not so light or rare:
Not fire; for she doth freeze with faint desire.

Then needs another element inquire
Whereof she might be made; that is, the sky.
For to the heaven her haughty looks aspire,
And eke her love is pure immortal high.
Then since to heaven ye likened are the best,
Be like in mercy as in all the rest."
"The weary yeare his race now having run,
The new begins his compast course anew:
With shew of morning mylde he hath begun,
Betokening peace and plenty to ensew.
So let us, which this chaunge of weather vew,
Chaunge eeke our mynds and former lives amend,
The old yeares sinnes forepast let us eschew,
And fly the faults with which we did offend.
Then shall the new yeares joy forth freshly send,
Into the glooming world his gladsome ray:
And all these stormes which now his beauty blend,
Shall turne to caulmes and tymely cleare away.
So likewise love cheare you your heavy spright,
And chaunge old yeares annoy to new delight."
"To all those happy blessings which ye have,
With plenteous hand by heaven upon you thrown:
This one disparagement they to you gave,
That ye your love lent to so meane a one.
Yee whose high worths surpassing paragon,
Could not on earth have found one fit for mate,
Ne but in heaven matchable to none,
Why did ye stoup unto so lowly state.
But ye thereby much greater glory gate,
Then had ye sorted with a princes pere:
For now your light doth more it selfe dilate,
And in my darknesse greater doth appeare.
Yet since your light hath once enlumind me,
With my reflex yours shall encreased be."
"Fresh spring the herald of loves mighty king,
In whose cote armour richly are displayed
All sorts of flowers the which on earth do spring
In goodly colours gloriously arrayd:
Goe to my love, where she is carelesse layd,
Yet in her winters bowre not well awake:
Tell her the joyous time wil not be staid
Unless she doe him by the forelock take.
Bid her therefore her selfe soone ready make,
To wayt on love amongst his lovely crew:
Where every one that misseth then her make,
Shall be by him amearst with penance dew.
Make hast therefore sweet love, whilest it is prime,
For none can call againe the passed time."
"I joy to see how in your drawen work,
Your selfe unto the Bee ye doe compare;
And me unto the Spyder that doth lurke,
In close awayt to catch her unaware.
Right so your selfe were caught in cunning snare
Of a deare for, and thralled to his love:
In whose streight bands ye now captived are
So firmely, that ye never may remove.
But as your whole worke is woven all about,
With woodbynd flowers and fragrant Enlantine:
So sweet your prison you in time shall prove,
With many deare delights bedecked fyne,
And all thensforth eternall peace shall see
Betweene the Spyder and the gentle Bee."
"Fayre is my love, when her fayre golden heares,
With the loose wynd ye waving chance to marke:
Fayre when the rose in her red cheekes appears,
Or in her eyes the fyre of love does sparke.
Fayre when her brest lyke a rich laden barke,
With pretious merchandize she forth doth lay:
Fayre when that cloud of pryde which oft doth dark
Her goodly light with smiles she drives away,
But fayrest she, when so she doth display
The gate with pearles and rubyes richly dight:
Throgh which her words so wise do make their way
To beare the message of her gentle spright.
The rest be works of natures wonderment,
But this the worke of harts astonishment."
"Lyke as the Culver on the bared bough,
Sits mourning for the absence of her mate:
And in her songs sends many a wishfull vow,
For his returne that seemes to linger late,
So I alone now left disconsolate,
Mourne to my selfe the absence of my love:
And wandring here and there all desolate,
Seek with my playnts to match that mournful dove:
Ne joy of ought that under heaven doth hove,
Can comfort me, but her owne joyous sight:
Whose sweet aspect both God and man can move,
In her unspotted pleasauns to delight.
Dark is my day, whyles her fayre light I mis,
And dead my life that wants such lively blis."
"More then most faire, full of the living fire,
Kindled above unto the maker neere:
No eies but joyes, in which al powers conspire,
That to the world naught else be counted deare.
Thrugh your bright beams doth not the blinded guest
Shoot out his darts to base affections wound?
But Angels come to lead fraile mindes to rest
In chast desires on heavenly beauty bound.
You frame my thoughts and fashion me within,
You stop my toung, and teach my hart to speake,
You calme the storme that passion did begin,
Strong thrugh your cause, but by your vertue weak.
Dark is the world, where your light shined never;
Well is he borne, that may behold you ever."
"In that proud port, which her so goodly graceth,
Whiles her faire face she reares up to the skie:
And to the ground her eie lids low embaseth
Most goodly temperature ye may descry,
Myld humblesse mixt with awfull majesty,
For looking on the earth whence she was borne:
Her minde remembreth her mortalitie,
What so is fayrest shall to earth returne.
But that same lofty countenance seemes to scorne
Base thing, and thinke how she to heaven may clime:
Treading downe earth as lothsome and forlorne,
That hinders heavenly thoughts with drossy slime.
Yet lowly still vouchsafe to looke on me,
Such lowlinesse shall make you lofty be."
"Ye tradefull Merchants that with weary toyle,
Do seeke most pretious things to make your gain:
And both the Indias of their treasures spoile,
What needeth you to seeke so farre in vaine?
For loe my love doth in her selfe containe
All this worlds riches that may farre be found,
If Saphyres, loe hir eies be Saphyres plaine,
If Rubies, loe hir lips be Rubies sound:
If Pearles, hir teeth be pearles both pure and round;
If Yvorie, her forhead yvory weene;
If Gold, her locks are finest gold on ground;
If silver, her faire hands are silver sheene;
But that which fairest is, but few behold,
Her mind adornd with vertues manifold."
"Penelope for her Ulisses sake,
Devizd a Web her wooers to deceave:
In which the worke that she all day did make
The same at night she did again unreave:
Such subtile craft my Damzell doth conceave,
Th importune suit of my desire to shnone:
For all that I in many dayes doo weave,
In one short houre I find by her undonne.
So when I thinke to end that I begonne,
I must begin and never bring to end:
For with one looke she spils that long I sponne,
And with one word my whole years work doth rend.
Such labour like the Spyders web I fynd,
Whose fruitless worke is broken with least wynd."
"My Love is like to ice, and I to fire:
How comes it then that this her cold so great
Is not dissolved through my so hot desire,
But harder grows the more I her entreat?
Or how comes it that my exceeding heat
Is not allayed by her heart-frozen cold,
But that I burn much more in boiling sweat,
And feel my flames augmented manifold?
What more miraculous thing may be told,
That fire, which all things melts, should harden ice,
And ice, which is congeald with senseless cold,
Should kindle fire by wonderful device?
Such is the power of love in gentle mind,
That it can alter all the course of kind."
"Though beauty be the mark of praise,
   And yours of whom I sing be such
   As not the world can praise too much,
Yet tis your virtue now I raise.

A virtue, like allay, so gone
   Throughout your form, as, though that move
   And draw and conquer all mens love,
This subjects you to love of one.

Wherein you triumph yet; because
   Tis of yourself, and that you use
   The noblest freedom, not to choose
Against or faith or honors laws.

But who should less expect from you,
   In whom alone Love lives again?
   By whom he is restored to men,
And kept, and bred, and brought up true.

His falling temples you have reared,
   The withered garlands taen away;
   His altars kept from the decay
That envy wished, and nature feared;

And on them burn so chaste a flame,
   With so much loyalties expense,
   As Love, t acquit such excellence,
Is gone himself into your name.

And you are he; the deity
   To whom all lovers are designed
   That would their better objects find;
Among which faithful troop am I.

Who, as an offspring at your shrine,
   Have sung this hymn, and here entreat
   One spark of your diviner heat
To light upon a love of mine.

Which, if it kindle not, but scant
   Appear, and that to shortest view,
   Yet give me leave t adore in you
What I in her am grieved to want."
"And if I did, what then?
Are you aggrievd therefore?
The sea hath fish for every man,
And what would you have more?

   Thus did my mistress once,
Amaze my mind with doubt;
And poppd a question for the nonce
To beat my brains about.

   Whereto I thus replied:
Each fisherman can wish
That all the seas at every tide
Were his alone to fish.

   And so did I (in vain)
But since it may not be,
Let such fish there as find the gain,
And leave the loss for me.

   And with such luck and loss
I will content myself,
Till tides of turning time may toss
Such fishers on the shelf.

   And when they stick on sands,
That every man may see,
Then will I laugh and clap my hands,
As they do now at me."
"All Kings, and all their favourites,
         All glory of honours, beauties, wits,
    The sun itself, which makes times, as they pass,
    Is elder by a year now than it was
    When thou and I first one another saw:
    All other things to their destruction draw,
         Only our love hath no decay;
    This no tomorrow hath, nor yesterday,
    Running it never runs from us away,
But truly keeps his first, last, everlasting day.

         Two graves must hide thine and my corse;
         If one might, death were no divorce.
    Alas, as well as other Princes, we
    (Who Prince enough in one another be)
    Must leave at last in death these eyes and ears,
    Oft fed with true oaths, and with sweet salt tears;
         But souls where nothing dwells but love
    (All other thoughts being inmates) then shall prove
    This, or a love increased there above,
When bodies to their graves, souls from their graves remove.

         And then we shall be throughly blessed;
         But we no more than all the rest.
    Here upon earth were Kings, and none but we
    Can be such Kings, nor of such subjects be;
    Who is so safe as we? where none can do
    Treason to us, except one of us two.
         True and false fears let us refrain,
    Let us love nobly, and live, and add again
    Years and years unto years, till we attain
To write threescore: this is the second of our reign."
"As you came from the holy land
Of Walsingham,
Met you not with my true love
By the way as you came?

How shall I know your true love,
That have met many one,
I went to the holy land,
That have come, that have gone?

She is neither white, nor brown,
But as the heavens fair;
There is none hath a form so divine
In the earth, or the air.

Such a one did I meet, good sir,
Such an angelic face,
Who like a queen, like a nymph, did appear
By her gait, by her grace.

She hath left me here all alone,
All alone, as unknown,
Who sometimes did me lead with herself,
And me loved as her own.

Whats the cause that she leaves you alone,
And a new way doth take,
Who loved you once as her own,
And her joy did you make?

I have lovd her all my youth;
But now old, as you see,
Love likes not the falling fruit
From the withered tree.

Know that Love is a careless child,
And forgets promise past;
He is blind, he is deaf when he list,
And in faith never fast.

His desire is a dureless content,
And a trustless joy:
He is won with a world of despair,
And is lost with a toy.

Of womenkind such indeed is the love,
Or the word love abusd,
Under which many childish desires
And conceits are excusd.

But true love is a durable fire,
In the mind ever burning,
Never sick, never old, never dead,
From itself never turning."
"Stella is sick, and in that sick-bed lies
Sweetness, that breathes and pants as oft as she;
And grace, sick too, such fine conclusions tries
That sickness brags itself best graced to be.
    Beauty is sick, but sick in so fair guise
That in that paleness beautys white we see;
And joy, which is inseparate from these eyes,
Stella now learns (strange case!) to weep in thee.
   Love moves thy pain, and like a faithful page,
As thy looks stir, runs up and down, to make
All folks prest at thy will thy pain to assuage;
Nature with care sweats for her darlings sake,
   Knowing worlds pass, ere she enough can find
   Of such heaven stuff, to clothe so heavenly mind."
"Where be the roses gone, which sweetened so our eyes?
    Where those red cheeks, which oft with fair increase did frame
    The height of honor in the kindly badge of shame?
Who hath the crimson weeds stolen from my morning skies?
How doth the color vade of those vermilion dyes,
    Which Nature's self did make, and self engrained the same!
    I would know by what right this paleness overcame
That hue, whose force my heart still unto thraldom ties?
    Galen's adoptive sons, who by a beaten way
    Their judgements hackney on, the fault on sickness lay;
But feeling proof makes me say they mistake it far:
    It is but love, which makes his paper perfect white
    To write therein more fresh the story of delight,
Whiles beauty's reddest ink Venus for him doth stir."
"O absent presence, Stella is not here;
    False flattering hope, that with so fair a face
    Bare me in hand, that in this orphan place
Stella, I say my Stella, should appear.
What sayst thou now? Where is that dainty cheer
    Thou toldst mine eyes should help their famished case?
    But thou art gone, now that self-felt disgrace
Doth make me most to wish thy comfort near.
    But here I do store of fair ladies meet,
    Who may with charm of conversation sweet
Make in my heavy mould new thoughts to grow:
    Sure they prevail as much with me, as he
    That bade his friend, but then new maimed, to be
Merry with him, and not think of his woe."
"Stella, since thou so right a princess art
Of all the powers which life bestows on me,
There ere by them aught undertaken be
They first resort unto that sovereign part;
Sweet, for a while give respite to my heart,
Which pants as though it still should leap to thee,
And on my thoughts give thy lieutenancy
To this great cause, which needs both use and art,
And as a queen, who from her presence sends
Whom she employs, dismiss from thee my wit,
Till it have wrought what thy own will attends.
On servants shame oft masters blame doth sit.
Oh let not fools in me thy works reprove,
And scorning say, See what it is to love."
"Alas, have I not pain enough, my friend,
Upon whose breast a fiercer gripe doth tire
Than did on him who first stale down the fire,
While Love on me doth all his quiver spend,
But with your rhubarb words you must contend
To grieve me worse, in saying that Desire
Doth plunge my well-formed soul even in the mire
Of sinful thoughts, which do in ruin end?
If that be sin which doth the manners frame,
Well stayed with truth in word and faith of deed,
Ready of wit, and fearing naught but shame;
If that be sin which in fixed hearts doth breed
A loathing of all loose unchastity,
Then love is sin, and let me sinful be."
"Not at first sight, nor with a dribbed shot,
   Love gave the wound which while I breathe will bleed:
   But known worth did in mine of time proceed,
Till by degrees it had full conquest got.
I saw, and liked; I liked, but loved not;
   I loved, but straight did not what love decreed:
   At length to loves decrees I, forced, agreed,
Yet with repining at so partial lot.
   Now even that footstep of lost liberty
Is gone, and now like slave-born Muscovite
I call it praise to suffer tyranny;
And now employ the remnant of my wit
   To make myself believe that all is well,
   While with a feeling skill I paint my hell."
"Your words my friend (right healthful caustics) blame
My young mind marred, whom Love doth windlass so,
That mine own writings like bad servants show
My wits, quick in vain thoughts, in virtue lame,
That Plato I read for nought, but if he tame
Such coltish gyres, that to my birth I owe
Nobler desires, least else that friendly foe,
Great expectation, wear a train of shame.
For since mad March great promise made of me,
If now the May of my years much decline,
What can be hoped my harvest time will be?
Sure you say well, your wisdoms golden mine
Dig deep with learnings spade, now tell me this,
Hath this world ought so fair as Stella is?"
"The wisest scholar of the wight most wise
By Phoebus doom, with sugared sentence says
That Virtue, if it once met with our eyes,
Strange flames of love it in our souls would raise;
But, for that man with pain this truth descries,
While he each thing in senses balance weighs,
And so nor will nor can behold those skies
Which inward sun to heroic mind displays,
Virtue of late, with virtuous care to stir
Love of herself, takes Stellas shape, that she
To mortal eyes might sweetly shine in her.
It is most true, for since I her did see,
Virtues great beauty in that face I prove,
And find theffect, for I do burn in love."
"With how sad steps, O moon, thou climbst the skies!
How silently, and with how wan a face!
What! may it be that even in heavenly place
That busy archer his sharp arrows tries?
Sure, if that long-with-love-acquainted eyes
Can judge of love, thou feelst a lovers case:
I read it in thy looks; thy languished grace
To me, that feel the like, thy state descries.
Then, even of fellowship, O Moon, tell me,
Is constant love deemed there but want of wit?
Are beauties there as proud as here they be?
Do they above love to be loved, and yet
    Those lovers scorn whom that love doth possess?
    Do they call virtue thereungratefulness?"
"What, have I thus betrayed my liberty?
Can those black beams such burning marks engrave
In my free side? or am I born a slave,
Whose neck becomes such yoke of tyranny?
Or want I sense to feel my misery?
Or sprite, disdain of such disdain to have?
Who for long faith, though daily help I crave,
May get no alms but scorn of beggary.
Virtue, awake! Beauty but beauty is;
I may, I must, I can, I will, I do
Leave following that which it is gain to miss.
Let her go. Soft, but here she comes. Go to,
Unkind, I love you not! O me, that eye
Doth make my heart give to my tongue the lie!"
"Souls joy, bend not those morning stars from me,
Where virtue is made strong by beautys might,
Where love is chasteness, pain doth learn delight,
And humbleness grows one with majesty.
Whatever may ensue, O let me be
Co-partner of the riches of that sight;
Let not mine eyes be hell-drivn from that light;
O look, O shine, O let me die and see.
For though I oft my self of them bemoan,
That through my heart their beamy darts be gone,
Whose cureless wounds even now most freshly bleed,
Yet since my death wound is already got,
Dear killer, spare not they sweet cruel shot;
A kind of grace it is to slay with speed."
"I on my horse, and Love on me, doth try
Our horsemanships, while by strange work I prove
A horseman to my horse, a horse to Love,
And now mans wrongs in me, poor beast, descry.
The reins wherewith my rider doth me tie
Are humbled thoughts, which bit of reverence move,
Curbed in with fear, but with gilt boss above
Of hope, which makes it seem fair to the eye.
The wand is will; thou, fancy, saddle art,
Girt fast by memory; and while I spur
My horse, he spurs with sharp desire to my heart;
He sits me fast, however I do stir;
And now hath made me to his hand so right
That in the manage myself takes delight."
"It is most true, that eyes are formed to serve
The inward light; and that the heavenly part
Ought to be king, from whose rules who do swerve,
Rebels to Nature, strive for their own smart.
    It is most true, what we call Cupids dart,
An image is, which for ourselves we carve;
And, fools, adore in temple of our heart,
Till that good god make Church and churchman starve.
    True, that true beauty virtue is indeed,
Whereof this beauty can be but a shade,
Which elements with mortal mixture breed;
True, that on earth we are but pilgrims made,
    And should in soul up to our country move;
True; and yet true, that I must Stella love."
"A strife is grown between Virtue and Love,
While each pretends that Stella must be his:
Her eyes, her lips, her all, saith Love, do this,
Since they do wear his badge, most firmly prove.
But Virtue thus that title doth disprove,
That Stella (O dear name) that Stella is
That virtuous soul, sure heir of heavnly bliss;
Not this fair outside, which our hearts doth move.
And therefore, though her beauty and her grace
Be Loves indeed, in Stellas self he may
By no pretense claim any manner place.
Well, Love, since this demur our suit doth stay,
Let Virtue have that Stella's self; yet thus,
Let Virtue but that body grant to us."
"O Grammar rules, O now your virtues show;
    So children still read you with awful eyes,
    As my young Dove may in your precepts wise
Her grant to me, by her own virtue know.
For late with heart most high, with eyes most low,
    I cravd the thing which ever she denies:
    She lightning Love, displaying Venus skies,
Least once should not be heard, twice said, No, No.
    Sing then my Muse, now Io Pan sing,
    Heavns envy not at my high triumphing:
But Grammars force with sweet success confirm,
    For Grammar says (O this dear Stella weigh,)
    For Grammar says (to Grammar who says nay)
That in one speech two Negatives affirm."
"Desire, though thou my old companion art,
And oft so clings to my pure Love that I
One from the other scarcely can descry,
While each doth blow the fire of my heart,
Now from thy fellowship I needs must part;
Venus is taught with Dians wings to fly;
I must no more in thy sweet passions lie;
Virtues gold now must head my Cupids dart.
Service and honor, wonder with delight,
Fear to offend, will worthy to appear,
Care shining in mine eyes, faith in my sprite:
These things are let me by my only dear;
But thou, Desire, because thou wouldst have all,
Now banished art. But yet alas how shall?"
"Stella, think not that I by verse seek fame,
Who seek, who hope, who love, who live but thee;
Thine eyes my pride, thy lips my history;
If thou praise not, all other praise is shame.
Nor so ambitious am I, as to frame
A nest for my young praise in laurel tree:
In truth I sweare, I wish not there should be
Graved in mine epitaph a Poets name:
Nay if I would, could I just title make,
That any laud to me thereof should grow,
Without my plumes from others wings I take.
For nothing from my wit or will doth flow,
Since all my words thy beauty doth endite,
And love doth hold my hand, and makes me write."
"O come, soft rest of cares! come, Night!
       Come, naked Virtues only tire,
The reaped harvest of the light
    Bound up in sheaves of sacred fire,
       Love calls to war:
             Sighs his alarms,
       Lips his swords are,
             The fields his arms.

Come, Night, and lay thy velvet hand
    On glorious Days outfacing face;
And all thy crowned flames command
    For torches to our nuptial grace.
       Love calls to war:
             Sighs his alarms,
       Lips his swords are,
             The field his arms."
"There is a garden in her face
   Where roses and white lilies blow;
A heavenly paradise is that place,
   Wherein all pleasant fruits do flow:
      There cherries grow which none may buy
      Till Cherry-ripe themselves do cry.

Those cherries fairly do enclose
   Of orient pearl a double row,
Which when her lovely laughter shows,
   They look like rose-buds filled with snow;
      Yet them no peer nor prince can buy
      Till Cherry-ripe themselves do cry.

Her eyes like angels watch them still;
   Her brows like bended bows do stand,
Threat'ning with piercing frowns to kill
   All that attempt with eye or hand
      Those sacred cherries to come nigh,
      Till Cherry-ripe themselves do cry."
"The time is come, I must depart
   from thee, ah famous city;
I never yet to rue my smart,
   did find that thou hadst pity.
Wherefore small cause there is, that I
   should grieve from thee to go;
But many women foolishly,
   like me, and other moe,
Do such a fixed fancy set,
   on those which least deserve,
That long it is ere wit we get   
   away from them to swerve.
But time with pity oft will tell   
   to those that will her try,
Whether it best be more to mell,
   or utterly defy.
And now hath time me put in mind
   of thy great cruelness,
That never once a help would find,
   to ease me in distress.
Thou never yet wouldst credit give
   to board me for a year;
Nor with apparel me relieve,
   except thou payed were.
No, no, thou never didst me good,
   nor ever wilt, I know.
Yet am I in no angry mood,
   but will, or ere I go,
In perfect love and charity,
   my testament here write,
And leave to thee such treasury,
   as I in it recite.
Now stand aside and give me leave
      to write my latest will;
And see that none you do deceive
   of that I leave them till."
"O happy dames, that may embrace
The fruit of your delight,
Help to bewail the woeful case
And eke the heavy plight
Of me, that wonted to rejoice
The fortune of my pleasant choice;
Good ladies, help to fill my mourning voice.

In ship, freight with remembrance
Of thoughts and pleasures past,
He sails that hath in governance
My life while it will last;
With scalding sighs, for lack of gale,
Furthering his hope, that is his sail,
Toward me, the sweet port of his avail.

Alas! how oft in dreams I see
Those eyes that were my food;
Which sometime so delighted me,
That yet they do me good;
Wherewith I wake with his return,
Whose absent flame did make me burn:
But when I find the lack, Lord, how I mourn!

When other lovers in arms across
Rejoice their chief delight.
Drowned in tears, to mourn my loss
I stand the bitter night
In my window, where I may see
Before the winds how the clouds flee.
Lo! what a mariner love hath made of me!

And in green waves when the salt flood
Doth rise by rage of wind,
A thousand fancies in that mood
Assail my restless mind.
Alas! now drencheth my sweet foe,
That with the spoil of my heart did go,
And left me; but, alas! why did he so?

And when the seas wax calm again
To chase fro me annoy,
My doubtful hope doth cause me pain;
So dread cuts off my joy.
Thus is my wealth mingled with woe,
And of each thought a doubt doth grow;
Now he comes! Will he come? Alas, no, no!
 "
"Unto the boundless Ocean of thy beauty
Runs this poor river, charged with streams of zeal:
Returning thee the tribute of my duty,
Which here my love, my youth, my plaints reveal.
Here I unclasp the book of my charged soul,
Where I have cast th'accounts of all my care:
Here have I summed my sighs, here I enroll
How they were spent for thee; look what they are.
Look on the dear expenses of my youth,
And see how just I reckon with thine eyes:
Examine well thy beauty with my truth,
And cross my cares ere greater sum arise.
Read it sweet maid, though it be done but slightly;
Who can show all his love, doth love but lightly."
"Go wailing verse, the infants of my love,
Minerva-like, brought forth without a Mother:
Present the image of the cares I prove,
Witness your Fathers grief exceeds all other.
Sigh out a story of her cruel deeds,
With interrupted accents of despair:
A monument that whosoever reads,
May justly praise, and blame my loveless Fair.
Say her disdain hath dried up my blood,
And starved you, in succours still denying:
Press to her eyes, importune me some good;
Waken her sleeping pity with your crying.
Knock at that hard heart, beg till you have moved her;
And tell thunkind, how dearly I have loved her."
"But love whilst that thou mayst be loved again,
Now whilst thy May hath filed thy lap with flowers,
Now whilst thy beauty bears without a stain,
Now use the summer smiles, ere winter lowers.
And whilst thou spreadst unto the rising sun
The fairest flower that ever saw the light,
Now joy thy time before thy sweet be done,
And, Delia, think thy morning must have night,
And that thy brightness sets at length to west,
When thou wilt close up that which now thou shewst;
And think the same becomes they fading best
Which then shall most inveil and shadow most.
Men do not weigh the stalk for what it was,
When once they find her flower, her glory, pass."
"But love whilst that thou mayst be loved again,
Now whilst thy May hath filled thy lap with flowers,
Now whilst thy beauty bears without a stain,
Now use the summer smiles, ere winter lowers.
And whilst thou spreadst unto the rising sun
The fairest flower that ever saw the light,
Now joy thy time before thy sweet be done,
And, Delia, think thy morning must have night,
And that thy brightness sets at length to west,
When thou wilt close up that which now thou shewst;
And think the same becomes thy fading best
Which then shall most inveil and shadow most.
Men do not weigh the stalk for what it was,
When once they find her flower, her glory, pass."
"When men shall find thy flower, thy glory pass,
And thou, with careful brow sitting alone,
Received hast this message from thy glass,
That tells thee truth, and says that all is gone,
Fresh shalt thou see in me the wounds thou madest,
Though spent thy flame, in me the heat remaining,
I that have loved thee thus before thou fadest,
My faith shall wax, when thou art in thy waning.
The world shall find this miracle in me,
That fire can burn when all the matters spent;
Then what my faith hath been thyself shall see,
And that thou wast unkind thou mayst repent.
Thou mayst repent that thou hast scorned my tears,
When Winter snows upon thy golden hairs."
"Unhappy pen and ill accepted papers,
That intimate in vain my chaste desires,
My chaste desires, the ever burning tapers,
Enkindled by her eyes celestial fires.
Celestial fires and unrespecting powers,
That deign not view the glory of your might,
In humble lines the work of careful hours,
The sacrifice I offer to her sight.
But since she scorns her own, this rests for me,
Ill moan my self, and hide the wrong I have:
And so content me that her frowns should be
To my infant style the cradle, and the grave.
What though my self no honor get thereby,
Each bird sings therself, and so will I."
"A face that should content me wondrous well
Should not be fair but lovely to behold,
With gladsome cheer all grief for to expel;
With sober looks so would I that it should
Speak without words such words as none can tell;
Her tress also should be of crisped gold;
With wit; and thus might chance I might be tied,
And knit again the knot that should not slide."
"In summers heat and mid-time of the day
To rest my limbs upon a bed I lay,
One window shut, the other open stood,
Which gave such light as twinkles in a wood,
Like twilight glimpse at setting of the sun
Or night being past, and yet not day begun.
Such light to shamefaced maidens must be shown,
Where they may sport, and seem to be unknown.
Then came Corinna in a long loose gown,
Her white neck hid with tresses hanging down:
Resembling fair Semiramis going to bed
Or Lais of a thousand wooers sped.
I snatched her gown, being thin, the harm was small,
Yet strived she to be covered therewithal.
And striving thus as one that would be cast,
Betrayed herself, and yielded at the last.
Stark naked as she stood before mine eye,
Not one wen in her body could I spy.

What arms and shoulders did I touch and see,
How apt her breasts were to be pressed by me?
How smooth a belly under her waist saw I?
How large a leg, and what a lusty thigh?
To leave the rest, all liked me passing well,
I clinged her naked body, down she fell,
Judge you the rest: being tired she bad me kiss,
Jove send me more such afternoons as this."
"So, so breake off this last lamenting kisse,
    Which sucks two soules, and vapours Both away,
Turne thou ghost that way, and let mee turne this,
    And let our selves benight our happiest day,
We askd none leave to love; nor will we owe
    Any, so cheape a death, as saying, Goe;

Goe; and if that word have not quite kild thee,
    Ease mee with death, by bidding mee goe too.
Oh, if it have, let my word worke on mee,
    And a just office on a murderer doe.
Except it be too late, to kill me so,
    Being double dead, going, and bidding, goe."
"Farewell, false love, the oracle of lies,
A mortal foe and enemy to rest,
An envious boy, from whom all cares arise,
A bastard vile, a beast with rage possessed,
A way of error, a temple full of treason,
In all effects contrary unto reason.

A poisoned serpent covered all with flowers,
Mother of sighs, and murderer of repose,
A sea of sorrows whence are drawn such showers
As moisture lend to every grief that grows;
A school of guile, a net of deep deceit,
A gilded hook that holds a poisoned bait.

A fortress foiled, which reason did defend,
A siren song, a fever of the mind,
A maze wherein affection finds no end,
A raging cloud that runs before the wind,
A substance like the shadow of the sun,
A goal of grief for which the wisest run.

A quenchless fire, a nurse of trembling fear,
A path that leads to peril and mishap,
A true retreat of sorrow and despair,
An idle boy that sleeps in pleasure's lap,
A deep mistrust of that which certain seems,
A hope of that which reason doubtful deems.

Sith then thy trains my younger years betrayed,
And for my faith ingratitude I find;
And sith repentance hath my wrongs bewrayed,
Whose course was ever contrary to kind:
False love, desire, and beauty frail, adieu!
Dead is the root whence all these fancies grew."
"Mark but this flea, and mark in this,   
How little that which thou deniest me is;   
It sucked me first, and now sucks thee,
And in this flea our two bloods mingled be;   
Thou knowst that this cannot be said
A sin, nor shame, nor loss of maidenhead,
    Yet this enjoys before it woo,
    And pampered swells with one blood made of two,
    And this, alas, is more than we would do.

Oh stay, three lives in one flea spare,
Where we almost, nay more than married are.   
This flea is you and I, and this
Our mariage bed, and marriage temple is;   
Though parents grudge, and you, w'are met,   
And cloistered in these living walls of jet.
    Though use make you apt to kill me,
    Let not to that, self-murder added be,
    And sacrilege, three sins in killing three.

Cruel and sudden, hast thou since
Purpled thy nail, in blood of innocence?   
Wherein could this flea guilty be,
Except in that drop which it sucked from thee?   
Yet thou triumphst, and say'st that thou   
Findst not thy self, nor me the weaker now;
    Tis true; then learn how false, fears be:
    Just so much honor, when thou yieldst to me,
    Will waste, as this fleas death took life from thee."
"You must not wonder, though you think it strange,
To see me hold my louring head so low,
And that mine eyes take no delight to range
About the gleams which on your face do grow.
The mouse which once hath broken out of trap
Is seldom ticed with the trustless bait,
But lies aloof for fear of more mishap,
And feedeth still in doubt of deep deceit.
The scorched fly, which once hath scaped the flame,
Will hardly come to play again with fire,
Whereby I learn that grievous is the game
Which follows fancy dazzled by desire:
So that I wink or else hold down my head,
Because your blazing eyes my bale have bred."
"Fortune hath taken thee away, my love,
My lifes soul and my souls heaven above;
Fortune hath taken thee away, my princess;
My only light and my true fancys mistress.

Fortune hath taken all away from me,
Fortune hath taken all by taking thee.
Dead to all joy, I only live to woe,
So fortune now becomes my mortal foe.

In vain you eyes, you eyes do waste your tears,
In vain you sighs do smoke forth my despairs,
In vain you search the earth and heaven above,
In vain you search, for fortune rules in love.

Thus now I leave my love in fortunes hands,
Thus now I leave my love in fortunes bands,
And only love the sorrows due to me;
Sorrow henceforth it shall my princess be.

I joy in this, that fortune conquers kings;
Fortune that rules on earth and earthly things
Hath taken my love in spite of Cupids might;
So blind a dame did never Cupid right.

With wisdoms eyes had but blind Cupid seen,
Then had my love my love for ever been;
But love farewell; though fortune conquer thee,
No fortune base shall ever alter me."
"Only joy, now here you are,
Fit to hear and ease my care;
Let my whispering voice obtain,
Sweet reward for sharpest pain;
Take me to thee, and thee to me.
No, no, no, no, my dear, let be.

Night hath closed all in her cloak,
Twinkling stars love-thoughts provoke:
Danger hence good care doth keep,
Jealousy itself doth sleep;
Take me to thee, and thee to me.
No, no, no, no, my dear, let be.

Better place no wit can find,
Cupids yoke to loose or bind:
These sweet flowers on fine bed too,
Us in their best language woo;
Take me to thee, and thee to me.
No, no, no, no, my dear, let be.

This small light the moon bestows,
Serves thy beams but to disclose,
So to raise my hap more high;
Fear not else, none can us spy:
Take me to thee, and thee to me.
No, no, no, no, my dear, let be.

That you heard was but a mouse,
Dumb sleep holdeth all the house;
Yet asleep, methinks they say,
Young folks, take time while you may:
Take me to thee, and thee to me.
No, no, no, no, my dear, let be.

Niggard Time threats, if we miss
This large offer of our bliss,
Long stay ere he grant the same;
Sweet then, while each thing doth frame,
Take me to thee, and thee to me.
No, no, no, no, my dear, let be.

Your fair mother is abed,
Candles out, and curtains spread:
She thinks you do letters write.
Write, but first let me indite:
Take me to thee, and thee to me.
No, no, no, no, my dear, let be.

Sweet, alas, why strive you thus?
Concord better fitteth us:
Leave to Mars the force of hands,
Your power in your beauty stands;
Take me to thee, and thee to me.
No, no, no, no, my dear, let be.

Woe to me, and do you swear
Me to hate, but I forbear,
Cursed by my destines all
That brought me so high to fall:
Soon with my death I will please thee.
No, no, no, no, my dear, let be."
"Green groweth the holly,
So doth the ivy.
Though winter blasts blow never so high,
Green groweth the holly.

As the holly groweth green
And never changeth hue,
So I am, ever hath been,
Unto my lady true.

As the holly groweth green
With ivy all alone
When flowers cannot be seen
And greenwood leaves be gone,

Now unto my lady
Promise to her I make,
From all other only
To her I me betake.

Adieu, mine own lady,
Adieu, my special
Who hath my heart truly
Be sure, and ever shall."
"It lies not in our power to love or hate,
For will in us is overruled by fate.
When two are stripped, long ere the course begin,
We wish that one should lose, the other win;
And one especially do we affect
Of two gold ingots, like in each respect:
The reason no man knows; let it suffice
What we behold is censured by our eyes.
Where both deliberate, the love is slight:
Who ever loved, that loved not at first sight?"
"I care not for these ladies,
That must be wooed and prayed:
Give me kind Amaryllis,
The wanton country maid.
Nature art disdaineth,
Her beauty is her own.
Her when we court and kiss,
She cries, Forsooth, let go!
But when we come where comfort is,
She never will say no.

If I love Amaryllis,
She gives me fruit and flowers:
But if we love these ladies,
We must give golden showers.
Give them gold, that sell love,
Give me the nut-brown lass,
Who, when we court and kiss,
She cries, Forsooth, let go!
But when we come where comfort is,
She never will say no.

These ladies must have pillows,
And beds by strangers wrought;
Give me a bower of willows,
Of moss and leaves unbought,
And fresh Amaryllis,
With milk and honey fed;
Who, when we court and kiss,
She cries, Forsooth, let go!
But when we come where comfort is,
She never will say no."
"If love now reigned as it hath been
And were rewarded as it hath sin,

Noble men then would sure ensearch
All ways whereby they might it reach,

But envy reigneth with such disdain
And causeth lovers outwardly to refrain,

Which puts them to more and more
Inwardly most grievous and sore.

The fault in whom I cannot set,
But let them tell which love doth get

To lovers I put now sure this case:
Which of their loves doth get them grace?

And unto them which doth it know
Better than do I, I think it so."
"Adieu, farewell, earths bliss;
This world uncertain is;
Fond are lifes lustful joys;
Death proves them all but toys;
None from his darts can fly;
I am sick, I must die.
   Lord, have mercy on us!

Rich men, trust not in wealth,
Gold cannot buy you health;
Physic himself must fade.
All things to end are made,
The plague full swift goes by;
I am sick, I must die.
   Lord, have mercy on us!

Beauty is but a flower
Which wrinkles will devour;
Brightness falls from the air;
Queens have died young and fair;
Dust hath closed Helens eye.
I am sick, I must die.
   Lord, have mercy on us!

Strength stoops unto the grave,
Worms feed on Hectors brave;
Swords may not fight with fate,
Earth still holds ope her gate.
Come, come! the bells do cry.
I am sick, I must die.
   Lord, have mercy on us.

Wit with his wantonness
Tasteth deaths bitterness;
Hells executioner
Hath no ears for to hear
What vain art can reply.
I am sick, I must die.
   Lord, have mercy on us.

Haste, therefore, each degree,
To welcome destiny;
Heaven is our heritage,
Earth but a players stage;
Mount we unto the sky.
I am sick, I must die.
   Lord, have mercy on us."
"Tonight, grave sir, both my poor house, and I
Do equally desire your company;
Not that we think us worthy such a guest,
But that your worth will dignify our feast
With those that come, whose grace may make that seem
Something, which else could hope for no esteem.
It is the fair acceptance, sir, creates
The entertainment perfect, not the cates.
Yet shall you have, to rectify your palate,
An olive, capers, or some better salad
Ushering the mutton; with a short-legged hen,
If we can get her, full of eggs, and then
Lemons, and wine for sauce; to these a cony
Is not to be despaired of, for our money;
And, though fowl now be scarce, yet there are clerks,
The sky not falling, think we may have larks.
Ill tell you of more, and lie, so you will come:
Of partridge, pheasant, woodcock, of which some
May yet be there, and godwit, if we can;
Knat, rail, and ruff too. Howsoeer, my man
Shall read a piece of Virgil, Tacitus,
Livy, or of some better book to us,
Of which well speak our minds, amidst our meat;
And Ill profess no verses to repeat.
To this, if ought appear which I not know of,
That will the pastry, not my paper, show of.
Digestive cheese and fruit there sure will be;
But that which most doth take my Muse and me,
Is a pure cup of rich Canary wine,
Which is the Mermaids now, but shall be mine;
Of which had Horace, or Anacreon tasted,
Their lives, as so their lines, till now had lasted.
Tobacco, nectar, or the Thespian spring,
Are all but Luther's beer to this I sing.
Of this we will sup free, but moderately,
And we will have no Pooley, or Parrot by,
Nor shall our cups make any guilty men;
But, at our parting we will be as when
We innocently met. No simple word
That shall be uttered at our mirthful board,
Shall make us sad next morning or affright
The liberty that well enjoy tonight."
"Kind are her answers,
But her performance keeps no day;
Breaks time, as dancers
From their own music when they stray:
All her free favors
And smooth words wing my hopes in vain.
O did ever voice so sweet but only feign?
Can true love yield such delay,
Converting joy to pain?

Lost is our freedom,
When we submit to women so:
Why do we need em,
When in their best they work our woe?
There is no wisdom
Can alter ends, by Fate prefixed.
O why is the good of man with evil mixed?
Never were days yet called two,
But one night went betwixt."
"Love is a sickness full of woes,
All remedies refusing;
A plant that with most cutting grows,
Most barren with best using.
Why so?
More we enjoy it, more it dies;
If not enjoyed, it sighting cries,
Heigh ho!

Love is a torment of the mind,
A tempest everlasting;
And Jove hath made it of a kind
Not well, not full, nor fasting.
Why so?
More we enjoy it, more it dies;
If not enjoyed, it sighing cries,
Heigh ho!"
"Pack, clouds away! and welcome day!
With night we banish sorrow;
Sweet air, blow soft, mount larks aloft
To give my love good-morrow!
Wings from the wind to please her mind,
Notes from the lark Ill borrow;
Bird, prune thy wing, nightingale, sing,
To give my love good-morrow;
To give my love good-morrow;
Notes from them both Ill borrow.

Wake from thy nest, Robin Redbreast,
Sing birds in every furrow;
And from each hill, let music shrill
Give my fair love good-morrow!
Blackbird and thrush in every bush,
Stare, linnet, and cock-sparrow!
You pretty elves, amongst yourselves,
Sing my fair love good-morrow;
To give my love good-morrow,
Sing birds in every furrow."
"I scarce believe my love to be so pure
   As I had thought it was,
   Because it doth endure
Vicissitude, and season, as the grass;
Methinks I lied all winter, when I swore
My love was infinite, if spring make it more.

But if medicine, love, which cures all sorrow
With more, not only be no quintessence,
But mixed of all stuffs paining soul or sense,
And of the sun his working vigor borrow,
Loves not so pure, and abstract, as they use
To say, which have no mistress but their muse,
But as all else, being elemented too,
Love sometimes would contemplate, sometimes do.

And yet no greater, but more eminent,
   Love by the spring is grown;
   As, in the firmament,
Stars by the sun are not enlarged, but shown,
Gentle love deeds, as blossoms on a bough,
From loves awakened root do bud out now.

If, as water stirred more circles be
Produced by one, love such additions take,
Those, like so many spheres, but one heaven make,
For they are all concentric unto thee;
And though each spring do add to love new heat,
As princes do in time of action get
New taxes, and remit them not in peace,
No winter shall abate the springs increase."
"Ay, beshrew you! by my fay,
These wanton clerks be nice alway!
Avaunt, avaunt, my popinjay!
What, will ye do nothing but play?
Tilly, vally, straw, let be I say!
Gup, Christian Clout, gup, Jack of the Vale!
With Mannerly Margery Milk and Ale.

By God, ye be a pretty pode,
And I love you an whole cart-load.
Straw, James Foder, ye play the fode,
I am no hackney for your rod:
Go watch a bull, your back is broad!
Gup, Christian Clout, gup, Jack of the Vale!
With Mannerly Margery Milk and Ale.

Ywis ye deal uncourteously;
What, would ye frumple me? now fy!
What, and ye shall be my pigesnye?
By Christ, ye shall not, no hardely:
I will not be japed bodily!
Gup, Christian Clout, gup, Jack of the Vale!
With Mannerly Margery Milk and Ale.

Walk forth your way, ye cost me nought;
Now have I found that I have sought:
The best cheap flesh that I ever bought.
Yet, for his love that all hath wrought,
Wed me, or else I die for thought.
Gup, Christian Clout, your breath is stale!
Go, Mannerly Margery Milk and Ale!
Gup, Christian Clout, gup, Jack of the Vale!
With Mannerly Margery Milk and Ale."
"Man of himselfs a little world, but joind
With woman, woman for that end designd,
(Hear cruel fair one whilst I this rehearse!)
He makes up then a complete universe.
Man, like this sublunary world, is born
The sport of two cross planets, love, and scorn:
Woman the other world resembles well,
In whose looks Heavn is, in whose breast Hell."
"The lowest trees have tops, the ant her gall,
The fly her spleen, the little sparks their heat;
The slender hairs cast shadows, though but small,
And bees have stings, although they be not great;
Seas have their source, and so have shallow springs;
And love is love, in beggars as in kings.

Where rivers smoothest run, deep are the fords;
The dial stirs, yet none perceives it move;
The firmest faith is in the fewest words;
The turtles cannot sing, and yet they love:
True hearts have eyes and ears, no tongues to speak;
They hear and see, and sigh, and then they break."
"Come, O come, my lifes delight,
Let me not in languor pine!
Love loves no delay; thy sight,
The more enjoyed, the more divine:
O come, and take from me
The pain of being deprived of thee!

Thou all sweetness dost enclose,
Like a little world of bliss.
Beauty guards thy looks: the rose
In them pure and eternal is.
Come, then, and make thy flight
As swift to me, as heavenly light."
"My sweetest Lesbia, let us live and love,
And though the sager sort our deeds reprove,
Let us not weigh them. Heavens great lamps do dive
Into their west, and straight again revive,
But soon as once set is our little light,
Then must we sleep one ever-during night.

If all would lead their lives in love like me,
Then bloody swords and armor should not be;
No drum nor trumpet peaceful sleeps should move,
Unless alarm came from the camp of love.
But fools do live, and waste their little light,
And seek with pain their ever-during night.

When timely death my life and fortune ends,
Let not my hearse be vexed with mourning friends,
But let all lovers, rich in triumph, come
And with sweet pastimes grace my happy tomb;
And Lesbia, close up thou my little light,
And crown with love my ever-during night."
"Never love unless you can
Bear with all the faults of man:
Men sometimes will jealous be
Though but little cause they see;
And hang the head, as discontent,
And speak what straight they will repent.

Men that but one saint adore
Make a show of love to more.
Beauty must be scorned in none,
Though but truly served in one:
For what is courtship but disguise?
True hearts may have dissembling eyes.

Men, when their affairs require,
Must awhile themselves retire;
Sometimes hunt, and sometimes hawk,
And not ever sit and talk.
If these and such-like you can bear,
Then like, and love, and never fear!"
"The nightingale, as soon as April bringeth
Unto her rested sense a perfect waking,
While late bare earth, proud of new clothing, springeth,
Sings out her woes, a thorn her song-book making,
And mournfully bewailing,
Her throat in tunes expresseth
What grief her breast oppresseth
For Tereus force on her chaste will prevailing.
O Philomela fair, O take some gladness,
That here is juster cause of plaintful sadness:
Thine earth now springs, mine fadeth;
Thy thorn without, my thorn my heart invadeth.

Alas, she hath no other cause of anguish
But Tereus love, on her by strong hand wroken,
Wherein she suffering, all her spirits languish;
Full womanlike complains her will was broken.
But I, who daily craving,
Cannot have to content me,
Have more cause to lament me,
Since wanting is more woe than too much having.
O Philomela fair, O take some gladness,
That here is juster cause of plaintful sadness:
Thine earth now springs, mine fadeth;
Thy thorn without, my thorn my heart invadeth."
"Now winter nights enlarge
The number of their hours;
And clouds their storms discharge
Upon the airy towers.
Let now the chimneys blaze
And cups oerflow with wine,
Let well-turned words amaze
With harmony divine.
Now yellow waxen lights
Shall wait on honey love
While youthful revels, masques, and courtly sights
Sleeps leaden spells remove.

This time doth well dispense
With lovers long discourse;
Much speech hath some defense,
Though beauty no remorse.
All do not all things well;
Some measures comely tread,
Some knotted riddles tell,
Some poems smoothly read.
The summer hath his joys,
And winter his delights;
Though love and all his pleasures are but toys,
They shorten tedious nights."
"If all the world and love were young,
And truth in every Shepherds tongue,
These pretty pleasures might me move,
To live with thee, and be thy love.

Time drives the flocks from field to fold,
When Rivers rage and Rocks grow cold,
And Philomel becometh dumb,
The rest complains of cares to come.

The flowers do fade, and wanton fields,
To wayward winter reckoning yields,
A honey tongue, a heart of gall,
Is fancys spring, but sorrows fall.

Thy gowns, thy shoes, thy beds of Roses,
Thy cap, thy kirtle, and thy posies
Soon break, soon wither, soon forgotten:
In folly ripe, in reason rotten.

Thy belt of straw and Ivy buds,
The Coral clasps and amber studs,
All these in me no means can move
To come to thee and be thy love.

But could youth last, and love still breed,
Had joys no date, nor age no need,
Then these delights my mind might move
To live with thee, and be thy love."
"I grieve and dare not show my discontent,
I love and yet am forced to seem to hate,
I do, yet dare not say I ever meant,
I seem stark mute but inwardly do prate.
I am and not, I freeze and yet am burned,
Since from myself another self I turned.

My care is like my shadow in the sun,
Follows me flying, flies when I pursue it,
Stands and lies by me, doth what I have done.
His too familiar care doth make me rue it.
No means I find to rid him from my breast,
Till by the end of things it be supprest.

Some gentler passion slide into my mind,
For I am soft and made of melting snow;
Or be more cruel, love, and so be kind.
Let me or float or sink, be high or low.
Or let me live with some more sweet content,
Or die and so forget what love ere meant."
"Her lily hand her rosy cheek lies under,
Cozening the pillow of a lawful kiss;
Who, therefore angry, seems to part in sunder,
Swelling on either side to want his bliss;
Between whose hills her head entombed is;
Where like a virtuous monument she lies,
To be admired of lewd unhallowed eyes.

Without the bed her other fair hand was,
On the green coverlet, whose perfect white
Showed like an April daisy on the grass,
With pearly sweat resembling dew of night.
Her eyes, like marigolds, had sheathed their light,
And canopied in darkness sweetly lay
Till they might open to adorn the day.

Her hair like golden threads played with her breath
O modest wantons, wanton modesty!
Showing lifes triumph in the map of death,
And deaths dim look in lifes mortality.
Each in her sleep themselves so beautify
As if between them twain there were no strife,
But that life lived in death, and death in life.

Her breasts like ivory globes circled with blue,
A pair of maiden worlds unconquered,
Save of their lord no bearing yoke they knew,
And him by oath they truly honoured.
These worlds in Tarquin new ambition bred,
Who like a foul usurper went about
From this fair throne to heave the owner out.

What could he see but mightily he noted?
What did he note but strongly he desired?
What he beheld, on that he firmly doted,
And in his will his willful eye he tired.
With more than admiration he admired
Her azure veins, her alabaster skin,
Her coral lips, her snow-white dimpled chin.

As the grim lion fawneth oer his prey
Sharp hunger by the conquest satisfied,
So oer this sleeping soul doth Tarquin stay,
His rage of lust by gazing qualified;
Slacked, not suppressed; for, standing by her side,
His eye, which late this mutiny restrains,
Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins.

And they, like straggling slaves for pillage fighting,
Obdurate vassals fell exploits effecting.
In bloody death and ravishment delighting,
Nor childrens tears nor mothers groans respecting,
Swell in their pride, the onset still expecting.
Anon his beating heart, alarum striking,
Gives the hot charge and bids them do their liking.

His drumming heart cheers up his burning eye,
His eye commends the leading to his hand;
His hand, as proud of such a dignity,
Smoking with pride, marched on to make his stand
On her bare breast, the heart of all her land,
Whose ranks of blue veins, as his hand did scale,
Left their round turrets destitute and pale.

They, mustering to the quiet cabinet
Where their dear governess and lady lies,
Do tell her she is dreadfully beset
And fright her with confusion of their cries.
She, much amazed, breaks ope her locked-up eyes,
Who, peeping forth this tumult to behold,
Are by his flaming torch dimmed and controlled.

Imagine her as one in dead of night
From forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking,
That thinks she hath beheld some ghastly sprite,
Whose grim aspect sets every joint a-shaking.
What terror tis! but she, in worser taking,
From sleep disturbed, heedfully doth view
The sight which makes supposed terror true.

Wrapped and confounded in a thousand fears,
Like to a new-killed bird she trembling lies.
She dares not look; yet, winking, there appears
Quick-shifting antics ugly in her eyes.
Such shadows are the weak brains forgeries,
Who, angry that the eyes fly from their lights,
In darkness daunts them with more dreadful sights.

His hand, that yet remains upon her breast
(Rude ram, to batter such an ivory wall!)
May feel her heart (poor citizen) distressed,
Wounding itself to death, rise up and fall,
Beating her bulk, that his hand shakes withal.
This moves in him more rage and lesser pity,
To make the breach and enter this sweet city."
"Love in my bosom like a bee
Doth suck his sweet;
Now with his wings he plays with me,
Now with his feet.
Within mine eyes he makes his nest,
His bed amidst my tender breast;
My kisses are his daily feast,
And yet he robs me of my rest.
Ah, wanton, will ye?

And if I sleep, then percheth he
With pretty flight,
And makes his pillow of my knee
The livelong night.
Strike I my lute, he tunes the string;
He music plays if so I sing;
He lends me every lovely thing;
Yet cruel he my heart doth sting.
Whist, wanton, still ye!

Else I with roses every day
Will whip you hence,
And bind you, when you long to play,
For your offense.
Ill shut mine eyes to keep you in,
Ill make you fast it for your sin,
Ill count your power not worth a pin.
Alas! what hereby shall I win
If he gainsay me?

What if I beat the wanton boy
With many a rod?
He will repay me with annoy,
Because a god.
Then sit thou safely on my knee,
And let thy bower my bosom be;
Lurk in mine eyes, I like of thee.
O Cupid, so thou pity me,
Spare not, but play thee!"
"Whose sense in so evil consort, their stepdame Nature lays,
That ravishing delight in them most sweet tunes do not raise;
Or if they do delight therein, yet are so cloyed with wit,
As with sententious lips to set a title vain on it:
O let them hear these sacred tunes, and learn in wonders schools,
To be (in things past bounds of wit) fools, if they be not fools.

Who have so leaden eyes, as not to see sweet beautys show,
Or seeing, have so wooden wits, as not that worth to know;
Or knowing, have so muddy minds, as not to be in love;
Or loving, have so frothy thoughts, as easly thence to move:
Or let them see these heavenly beams, and in fair letters read
A lesson fit, both sight and skill, love and firm love to breed.

Hear then, but then with wonder hear; see but adoring see,
No mortal gifts, no earthly fruits, now here descended be;
See, do you see this face? a face? nay, image of the skies,
Of which the two life-giving lights are figured in her eyes:
Hear you this soul-invading voice, and count it but a voice?
The very essence of their tunes, when Angels do rejoice."
"Slow, slow, fresh fount, keep time with my salt tears;
Yet slower, yet, O faintly, gentle springs!
List to the heavy part the music bears,
Woe weeps out her division, when she sings.
Droop herbs and flowers;
Fall grief in showers;
Our beauties are not ours.
O, I could still,
Like melting snow upon some craggy hill,
Drop, drop, drop, drop,
Since natures pride is now a withered daffodil."
"Come away, come away, death,
    And in sad cypress let me be laid.
Fly away, fly away, breath;
    I am slain by a fair cruel maid.
My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,
             O, prepare it!
My part of death, no one so true
         Did share it.

Not a flower, not a flower sweet,
    On my black coffin let there be strown.
Not a friend, not a friend greet
    My poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown.
A thousand thousand sighs to save,
             Lay me, O, where
Sad true lover never find my grave,
             To weep there!"
"It was a lover and his lass,
   With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
That oer the green cornfield did pass,
   In springtime, the only pretty ring time,
When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding;
Sweet lovers love the spring.

Between the acres of the rye,
   With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
Those pretty country folks would lie,
   In springtime, the only pretty ring time,
When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding;
Sweet lovers love the spring.

This carol they began that hour,
   With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
How that a life was but a flower
   In springtime, the only pretty ring time,
When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding;
Sweet lovers love the spring.

And therefore take the present time,
   With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
For love is crowned with the prime
   In springtime, the only pretty ring time,
When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding;
Sweet lovers love the spring."
"Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more.
    Men were deceivers ever,
One foot in sea, and one on shore,
    To one thing constant never.
Then sigh not so, but let them go,
    And be you blithe and bonny,
Converting all your sounds of woe
    Into hey nonny, nonny.

Sing no more ditties, sing no more
    Of dumps so dull and heavy.
The fraud of men was ever so
    Since summer first was leafy.
Then sigh not so, but let them go,
    And be you blithe and bonny,
Converting all your sounds of woe
    Into hey, nonny, nonny."
"Come, my Celia, let us prove,
While we can, the sports of love;
Time will not be ours forever;
He at length our good will sever.
Spend not then his gifts in vain.
Suns that set may rise again;
But if once we lose this light,
Tis with us perpetual night.
Why should we defer our joys?
Fame and rumor are but toys.
Cannot we delude the eyes
Of a few poor household spies,
Or his easier ears beguile,
So removed by our wile?
Tis no sin loves fruit to steal;
But the sweet thefts to reveal,
To be taken, to be seen,
These have crimes accounted been."
"Who is Silvia? what is she,
    That all our swains commend her?
Holy, fair, and wise is she;
    The heaven such grace did lend her,
That she might admired be.

Is she kind as she is fair?
    For beauty lives with kindness.
Love doth to her eyes repair,
    To help him of his blindness;
And, being helped, inhabits there.

Then to Silvia let us sing,
    That Silvia is excelling;
She excels each mortal thing
    Upon the dull earth dwelling;
To her let us garlands bring"
"From fairest creatures we desire increase,
That thereby beautys rose might never die,
But as the riper should by time decease,
His tender heir might bear his memory;
But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
Feedst thy lights flame with self-substantial fuel,
Making a famine where abundance lies,
Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.
Though that art now the worlds fresh ornament
And only herald to the gaudy spring,
Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
And, tender churl, makst waste in niggarding.
   Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
   To eat the worlds due, by the grave and thee."
"When forty winters shall besiege thy brow
And dig deep trenches in thy beautys field,
Thy youths proud livery, so gazed on now,
Will be a tattered weed, of small worth held.
Then being asked where all thy beauty lies
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days
To say within thine own deep-sunken eyes
Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.
How much more praise deserved thy beautys use 
If thou couldst answer ""This fair child of mine
Shall sum my count and make my old excuse"", 
Proving his beauty by succession thine.
    This were to be new made when thou art old,
    And see thy blood warm when thou feelst it cold."
"Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,
Now is the time that face should form another,
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.
For where is she so fair whose uneared womb
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
Of his self-love, to stop posterity?
Thou art thy mothers glass, and she in thee
Calls back the lovely April of her prime;
So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,
Despite of wrinkles, this thy golden time.
    But if thou live remembred not to be,
    Die single, and thine image dies with thee."
"Shall I compare thee to a summers day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summers lease hath all too short a date;
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance or natures changing course untrimm'd;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owst;
Nor shall death brag thou wanderst in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou growst:
   So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
   So long lives this, and this gives life to thee."
"A womans face with natures own hand painted
Hast thou, the master-mistress of my passion;
A womans gentle heart, but not acquainted
With shifting change as is false womens fashion;
An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;
A man in hue, all hues in his controlling,
Which steals mens eyes and womens souls amazeth.
And for a woman wert thou first created,
Till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,
And by addition me of thee defeated
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.
      But since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure,
      Mine be thy love and thy loves use their treasure."
"No more be grieved at that which thou hast done:
Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud,
Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,
And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
All men make faults, and even I in this,
Authorizing thy trespass with compare,
Myself corrupting salving thy amiss,
Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are:
For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense
Thy adverse party is thy advocate
And gainst myself a lawful plea commence.
Such civil war is in my love and hate,
   That I an accessory needs must be
   To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me."
"Take all my loves, my love, yea, take them all:
What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?
No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call
All mine was thine before thou hadst this more.
Then if for my love thou my love receivest,
I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest;
But yet be blamed if thou this self deceivest
By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.
I do forgive thy robbry, gentle thief,
Although thou steal thee all my poverty;
And yet love knows it is a greater grief
To bear loves wrong than hates known injury.
    Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,
    Kill me with spites, yet we must not be foes."
"Not marble nor the gilded monuments
Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,
But you shall shine more bright in these contents
Than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time.
When wasteful war shall statues overturn,
And broils root out the work of masonry,
Nor Mars his sword nor wars quick fire shall burn
The living record of your memory.
Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity
Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room
Even in the eyes of all posterity
That wear this world out to the ending doom.
    So, till the Judgement that yourself arise,
    You live in this, and dwell in lovers eyes."
"Being your slave, what should I do but tend
Upon the hours and times of your desire?
I have no precious time at all to spend,
Nor services to do, till you require.
Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour
Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you.
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour
When you have bid your servant once adieu;
Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,
But like a sad slave, stay and think of nought,
Save, where you are how happy you make those.
So true a fool is love that in your will
Though you do anything, he thinks no ill."
"Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea
But sad mortality oer-sways their power,
How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,
Whose action is no stronger than a flower?
O, how shall summers honey breath hold out
Against the wrackful siege of battring days,
When rocks impregnable are not so stout,
Nor gates of steel so strong, but time decays?
O fearful meditation! where, alack,
Shall times best jewel from times chest lie hid?
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?
Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?
   O, none, unless this miracle have might,
   That in black ink my love may still shine bright."
"Why is my verse so barren of new pride,
So far from variation or quick change?
Why with the time do I not glance aside
To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?
Why write I still all one, ever the same,
And keep invention in a noted weed,
That every word doth almost tell my name,
Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?
O know, sweet love, I always write of you,
And you and love are still my argument,
So all my best is dressing old words new,
Spending again what is already spent:
   For as the sun is daily new and old,
   So is my love still telling what is told."
"Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,
And like enough thou knowst thy estimate.
The Charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;
My bonds in thee are all determinate.
For how do I hold thee but by thy granting,
And for that riches where is my deserving?
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,
And so my patent back again is swerving.
Thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing,
Or me, to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking,
So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,
Comes home again, on better judgement making.
   Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter:
   In sleep a king, but waking no such matter."
"From you have I been absent in the spring,
When proud-pied April, dressed in all his trim,
Hath put a spirit of youth in everything,
That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him.
Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell
Of different flowers in odour and in hue,
Could make me any summers story tell,
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:
Nor did I wonder at the lilys white,
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;
They were but sweet, but figures of delight
Drawn after you,  you pattern of all those.
    Yet seemd it winter still, and, you away,
    As with your shadow I with these did play."
"To me, fair friend, you never can be old,
For as you were when first your eye I eyed,
Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold
Have from the forests shook three summers pride,
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned
In process of the seasons have I seen,
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,
Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.
Ah, yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand,
Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived;
So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,
Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived:
For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred:
Ere you were born was beautys summer dead."
"O! never say that I was false of heart,
Though absence seemed my flame to qualify.
As easy might I from myself depart
As from my soul, which in thy breast doth lie:
That is my home of love; if I have ranged,
Like him that travels, I return again,
Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,
So that myself bring water for my stain.
Never believe, though in my nature reigned
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,
That it could so preposterously be stained,
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;
   For nothing this wide universe I call,
   Save thou, my rose; in it thou art my all."
"O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy powr
Dost hold times fickle glass his sickle hour,
Who hast by waning grown, and therein showst
Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self growst
In nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,
As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back,
She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill
May time disgrace, and wretched minute kill.
Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure;
She may detain but not still keep her treasure.
   Her audit, though delayed, answered must be,
   And her quietus is to render thee."
"Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy Will,
And Will to boot, and Will in overplus;
More than enough am I that vex thee still,
To thy sweet will making addition thus.
Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,
Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?
Shall will in others seem right gracious,
And in my will no fair acceptance shine?
The sea, all water, yet receives rain still,
And in abundance addeth to his store;
So thou being rich in Will add to thy Will
One will of mine, to make thy large Will more.
   Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill;
   Think all but one, and me in that one Will."
"When my love swears that she is made of truth,
I do believe her, though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
Unlearned in the worlds false subtleties.
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,
Although she knows my days are past the best,
Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue:
On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed.
But wherefore says she not she is unjust?
And wherefore say not I that I am old?
Oh, loves best habit is in seeming trust,
And age in love loves not to have years told.
    Therefore I lie with her and she with me,
    And in our faults by lies we flattered be."
"In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,
For they in thee a thousand errors note;
But tis my heart that loves what they despise,
Who, in despite of view, is pleased to dote;
Nor are mine ears with thy tongues tune delighted,
Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,
Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited
To any sensual feast with thee alone:
But my five wits nor my five senses can
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,
Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man,
Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be.
   Only my plague thus far I count my gain,
   That she that makes me sin awards me pain."
"Two loves I have of comfort and despair,
Which like two spirits do suggest me still
The better angel is a man right fair,
The worser spirit a woman coloured ill.
To win me soon to hell, my female evil
Tempteth my better angel from my side,
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,
Wooing his purity with her foul pride.
And, whether that my angel be turnd fiend,
Suspect I may, yet not directly tell,
But being both from me both to each friend,
I guess one angel in anothers hell.
   Yet this shall I neer know, but live in doubt,
   Till my bad angel fire my good one out."
"I that have been a lover, and could show it,
Though not in these, in rithmes not wholly dumb,
Since I exscribe your sonnets, am become
A better lover, and much better poet.
Nor is my Muse or I ashamed to owe it
To those true numerous graces, whereof some
But charm the senses, others overcome
Both brains and hearts; and mine now best do know it:
For in your verse all Cupids armory,
His flames, his shafts, his quiver, and his bow,
His very eyes are yours to overthrow.
But then his mothers sweets you so apply,
Her joys, her smiles, her loves, as readers take
For Venus ceston every line you make."
"Take, oh, take those lips away
That so sweetly were forsworn
And those eyes, like break of day,
Lights that do mislead the morn;
But my kisses bring again,
Seals of love, though sealed in vain.

Hide, oh, hide those hills of snow,
Which thy frozen bosom bears,
On whose tops the pinks that grow
Are of those that April wears;
But first set my poor heart free,
Bound in those icy chains by thee."
"Though I am young, and cannot tell
    Either what Death or Love is well,
Yet I have heard they both bear darts,
    And both do aim at human hearts.
And then again, I have been told
    Love wounds with heat, as Death with cold;
So that I fear they do but bring
    Extremes to touch, and mean one thing.

As in a ruin we it call
    One thing to be blown up, or fall;
Or to our end like way may have
    By a flash of lightning, or a wave;
So Loves inflamed shaft or brand
    May kill as soon as Deaths cold hand;
Except Loves fires the virtue have
    To fright the frost out of the grave."
"Though that men do call it dotage,
Who loveth not wanteth courage;

And whosoever may love get,
From Venus sure he must it fet

Or else from her which is her heir,
And she to him must seem most fair.

With eye and mind doth both agree.
There is no boot: there must it be.

The eye doth look and represent,
But mind afformeth with full consent.

Thus am I fixed without grudge:
Mine eye with heart doth me so judge.

Love maintaineth all noble courage.
Who love disdaineth is all of the village:

Such loversthough they take pain
It were pity they should obtain,

For often times where they do sue
They hinder lovers that would be true.

For whoso loveth should love but once.
Change whoso will, I will be none."
"Come, Madam, come, all rest my powers defy,
Until I labour, I in labour lie.
The foe oft-times having the foe in sight,
Is tird with standing though he never fight.
Off with that girdle, like heavens Zone glistering,
But a far fairer world encompassing.
Unpin that spangled breastplate which you wear,
That theyes of busy fools may be stopped there.
Unlace yourself, for that harmonious chime,
Tells me from you, that now it is bed time.
Off with that happy busk, which I envy,
That still can be, and still can stand so nigh.
Your gown going off, such beauteous state reveals,
As when from flowery meads thhills shadow steals.
Off with that wiry Coronet and shew
The hairy Diadem which on you doth grow:
Now off with those shoes, and then safely tread
In this loves hallowd temple, this soft bed.
In such white robes, heavens Angels used to be
Received by men; Thou Angel bringst with thee
A heaven like Mahomets Paradise; and though
Ill spirits walk in white, we easily know,
By this these Angels from an evil sprite,
Those set our hairs, but these our flesh upright.
    Licence my roving hands, and let them go,
Before, behind, between, above, below.
O my America! my new-found-land,
My kingdom, safeliest when with one man mannd,
My Mine of precious stones, My Empirie,
How blest am I in this discovering thee!
To enter in these bonds, is to be free;
Then where my hand is set, my seal shall be.
    Full nakedness! All joys are due to thee,
As souls unbodied, bodies unclothd must be,
To taste whole joys. Gems which you women use
Are like Atlantas balls, cast in mens views,
That when a fools eye lighteth on a Gem,
His earthly soul may covet theirs, not them.
Like pictures, or like books gay coverings made
For lay-men, are all women thus arrayd;
Themselves are mystic books, which only we
(Whom their imputed grace will dignify)
Must see reveald. Then since that I may know;
As liberally, as to a Midwife, shew
Thy self: cast all, yea, this white linen hence,
There is no penance due to innocence.
    To teach thee, I am naked first; why then
What needst thou have more covering than a man."
"Merry Margaret,
As midsummer flower,
Gentle as a falcon
Or hawk of the tower:
With solace and gladness,
Much mirth and no madness,
All good and no badness;
So joyously,
So maidenly,
So womanly
Her demeaning
In every thing,
Far, far passing
That I can indite,
Or suffice to write
Of Merry Margaret
As midsummer flower,
Gentle as falcon
Or hawk of the tower.
As patient and still
And as full of good will
As fair Isaphill,
Coriander,
Sweet pomander,
Good Cassander,
Steadfast of thought,
Well made, well wrought,
Far may be sought
Ere that ye can find
So courteous, so kind
As Merry Margaret,
This midsummer flower,
Gentle as falcon
Or hawk of the tower."
"That neither fame nor love might wanting be
To greatness, Cary, I sing that and thee;
Whose house, if it no other honor had,
In only thee might be both great and glad;
Who, to upbraid the sloth of this our time,
Durst valor make almost, but not, a crime;
Which deed I know not, whether were more high,
Or thou more happy, it to justify
Against thy fortune: when no foe, that day,
Could conquer thee but chance, who did betray.
Love thy great loss, which a renown hath won,
To live when Broick not stands, nor Ruhr doth run.
Love honors, which of best example be
When they cost dearest and are done most free;
Though every fortitude deserves applause,
It may be much or little in the cause.
Hes valiantst that dares fight, and not for pay;
That virtuous is, when the rewards away."
"Methought I saw the grave where Laura lay,
Within that temple where the vestal flame
Was wont to burn; and, passing by that way,
To see that buried dust of living fame,
Whose tomb fair Love, and fairer Virtue kept:
All suddenly I saw the Fairy Queen;
At whose approach the soul of Petrarch wept,
And, from thenceforth, those Graces were not seen:
For they this queen attended; in whose stead
Oblivion laid him down on Lauras hearse:
Hereat the hardest stones were seen to bleed,
And groans of buried ghosts the heavens did pierce:
Where Homers spright did tremble all for grief,
And cursed the access of that celestial thief!"
"When thou must home to shades of underground,
And there arrived, a new admired guest,
The beauteous spirits do engirt thee round,
White Iope, blithe Helen, and the rest,
To hear the stories of thy finished love
From that smooth tongue whose music hell can move;

Then wilt thou speak of banqueting delights,
Of masques and revels which sweet youth did make,
Of tourneys and great challenges of knights,
And all these triumphs for thy beautys sake:
When thou hast told these honours done to thee,
Then tell, O tell, how thou didst murder me!"
"As you came from the holy land
of Walsinghame
Met you not with my true love
By the way as you came?

How shall I know your true love
That have met many one
As I went to the holy land
That have come, that have gone?

She is neither white nor brown
But as the heavens fair
There is none hath a form so divine
In the earth or the air.

Such an one did I meet, good Sir,
Such an Angelic face,
Who like a queen, like a nymph, did appear
By her gait, by her grace.

She hath left me here all alone,
All alone as unknown,
Who sometimes did me lead with her self,
And me loved as her own.

Whats the cause that she leaves you alone
And a new way doth take;
Who loved you once as her own
And her joy did you make?

I have loved her all my youth,
But now old, as you see,
Love likes not the falling fruit
From the withered tree.

Know that love is a careless child
And forgets promise past,
He is blind, he is deaf when he list
And in faith never fast.

His desire is a dureless content
And a trustless joy
He is won with a world of despair
And is lost with a toy.

Of womenkind such indeed is the love
Or the word Love abused
Under which many childish desires
And conceits are excused.

But true Love is a durable fire
In the mind ever burning;
Never sick, never old, never dead,
From itself never turning."
"What length of verse can serve brave Mopsas good to show,
Whose virtues strange, and beauties such, as no man them may know?
Thus shrewdly burden, then, how can my Muse escape?
The gods must help, and precious things must serve to show her shape.

Like great god Saturn, fair, and like fair Venus, chaste;
As smooth as Pan, as Juno mild, like goddess Iris fast.
With Cupid she foresees, and goes god Vulcans pace;
And for a taste of all these gifts, she borrows Momus grace.

Her forehead jacinth-like, her cheeks of opal hue,
Her twinkling eyes bedecked with pearl, her lips of sapphire blue,
Her hair pure crapall stone, her mouth, O heavenly wide,
Her skin like burnished gold, her hands like silver ore untried.

As for those parts unknown, which hidden sure are best,
Happy be they which believe, and never seek the rest."
"When I was fair and young, then favor graced me.
Of many was I sought their mistress for to be.
But I did scorn them all and answered them therefore:
Go, go, go, seek some other where; importune me no more.

How many weeping eyes I made to pine in woe,
How many sighing hearts I have not skill to show,
But I the prouder grew and still this spake therefore:
Go, go, go, seek some other where, importune me no more.

Then spake fair Venus son, that proud victorious boy,
Saying: You dainty dame, for that you be so coy,
I will so pluck your plumes as you shall say no more:
Go, go, go, seek some other where, importune me no more.

As soon as he had said, such change grew in my breast
That neither night nor day I could take any rest.
Wherefore I did repent that I had said before:
Go, go, go, seek some other where, importune me no more."
"When to her lute Corinna sings,
Her voice revives the leaden strings,
And doth in highest notes appear
As any challenged echo clear;
But when she doth of mourning speak,
Evn with her sighs the strings do break.

And as her lute doth live or die,
Let by her passion, so must I:
For when of pleasure she doth sing,
My thoughts enjoy a sudden spring,
But if she doth of sorrow speak,
Evn from my heart the strings do break."
"Now thou has loved me one whole day,
Tomorrow when you leavst, what wilt thou say?
Wilt thou then antedate some new-made vow?
            Or say that now
We are not just those persons which we were?
Or, that oaths made in reverential fear
Of Love, and his wrath, any may forswear?
Or, as true deaths true marriages untie,
So lovers contracts, images of those,
Bind but till sleep, deaths image, them unloose?
            Or, your own end to justify,
For having purposed change and falsehood, you
Can have no way but falsehood to be true?
Vain lunatic, against these scapes I could
            Dispute and conquer, if I would,
            Which I abstain to do,
For by tomorrow, I may think so too."
"Womanhood, wanton, ye want:
Your meddling, mistress, is mannerless;
Plenty of ill, of goodness scant,
Ye rail at riot, reckless:
To praise your port it is needless;
For all your draff yet and your dregs,
As well borne as ye full oft time begs.

Why so coy and full of scorn?
Mine horse is sold, I ween, you say;
My new furred gown, when it is worn...
Put up your purse, ye shall not pay!
By crede, I trust to see the day,
As proud a pea-hen as ye spread,
Of me and other ye may have need!

Though angelic be your smiling,
Yet is your tongue an adders tail,
Full like a scorpion stinging
All those by whom ye have avail.
Good mistress Anne, there ye do shail:
What prate ye, pretty pigesnye?
I trust to quite you ere I die!

Your key is meet for every lock,
Your key is common and hangeth out;
Your key is ready, we need not knock,
Nor stand long wresting there about;
Of your door-gate ye have no doubt:
But one thing is, that ye be lewd:
Hold your tongue now, all beshrewd!

To mistress Anne, that farly sweet,
That wones at The Key in Thames Street.
 "
"Wyatt resteth here, that quick could never rest;
Whose heavenly gifts increased by disdain,
And virtue sank the deeper in his breast;
Such profit he of envy could obtain.

A head, where wisdom mysteries did frame,
Whose hammers beat still in that lively brain
As on a stith, where some work of fame
Was daily wrought, to turn to Britains gain.

A visage, stern and mild; where both did grow,
Vice to condemn, in virtues to rejoice;
Amid great storms whom grace assured so,
To live upright and smile at fortunes choice.

A hand that taught what might be said in rhyme;
That reft Chaucer the glory of his wit;
A mark the which (unperfited, for time)
Some may approach, but never none shall hit.

A tongue that served in foreign realms his king;
Whose courteous talk to virtue did enflame
Each noble heart; a worthy guide to bring
Our English youth, by travail unto fame.

An eye whose judgment no affect could blind,
Friends to allure, and foes to reconcile;
Whose piercing look did represent a mind
With virtue fraught, reposed, void of guile.

A heart where dread yet never so impressed
To hide the thought that might the truth avaunce;
In neither fortune lift, nor so repressed,
To swell in wealth, nor yield unto mischance.

A valiant corps, where force and beauty met,
Happy, alas! too happy, but for foes,
Lived, and ran the race that nature set;
Of manhoods shape, where she the mold did lose.

But to the heavens that simple soul is fled,
Which left with such, as covet Christ to know
Witness of faith that never shall be dead:
Sent for our health, but not received so.

Thus, for our guilt, this jewel have we lost;
The earth his bones, the heavens possess his ghost.
Amen."
"Twice or thrice had I lov'd thee,
Before I knew thy face or name;
So in a voice, so in a shapeless flame
Angels affect us oft, and worshipp'd be;
         Still when, to where thou wert, I came,
Some lovely glorious nothing I did see.
         But since my soul, whose child love is,
Takes limbs of flesh, and else could nothing do,
         More subtle than the parent is
Love must not be, but take a body too;
         And therefore what thou wert, and who,
                I bid Love ask, and now
That it assume thy body, I allow,
And fix itself in thy lip, eye, and brow.

Whilst thus to ballast love I thought,
And so more steadily to have gone,
With wares which would sink admiration,
I saw I had love's pinnace overfraught;
         Ev'ry thy hair for love to work upon
Is much too much, some fitter must be sought;
         For, nor in nothing, nor in things
Extreme, and scatt'ring bright, can love inhere;
         Then, as an angel, face, and wings
Of air, not pure as it, yet pure, doth wear,
         So thy love may be my love's sphere;
                Just such disparity
As is 'twixt air and angels' purity,
'Twixt women's love, and men's, will ever be."
"Alas, madam, for stealing of a kiss
Have I so much your mind there offended?
Have I then done so grievously amiss
That by no means it may be amended?

Then revenge you, and the next way is this:
Another kiss shall have my life ended,
For to my mouth the first my heart did suck;
The next shall clean out of my breast it pluck."
"The sovereign beauty which I do admire,
Witness the world how worthy to be praised:
The light whereof hath kindled heavenly fire
In my frail spirit, by her from baseness raised;
That being now with her huge brightness dazed,
Base thing I can no more endure to view;
But looking still on her, I stand amazed
At wondrous sight of so celestial hue.
So when my tongue would speak her praises due,
It stopped is with thought's astonishment:
And when my pen would write her titles true,
It ravish'd is with fancy's wonderment:
Yet in my heart I then both speak and write
The wonder that my wit cannot endite."
"Like as a huntsman after weary chase,
Seeing the game from him escap'd away,
Sits down to rest him in some shady place,
With panting hounds beguiled of their prey:
So after long pursuit and vain assay,
When I all weary had the chase forsook,
The gentle deer return'd the self-same way,
Thinking to quench her thirst at the next brook.
There she beholding me with milder look,
Sought not to fly, but fearless still did bide:
Till I in hand her yet half trembling took,
And with her own goodwill her firmly tied.
Strange thing, me seem'd, to see a beast so wild,
So goodly won, with her own will beguil'd."
"Most happy letters, fram'd by skilful trade,
With which that happy name was first design'd:
The which three times thrice happy hath me made,
With gifts of body, fortune, and of mind.
The first my being to me gave by kind,
From mother's womb deriv'd by due descent,
The second is my sovereign Queen most kind,
That honour and large richesse to me lent.
The third my love, my life's last ornament,
By whom my spirit out of dust was raised:
To speak her praise and glory excellent,
Of all alive most worthy to be praised.
Ye three Elizabeths for ever live,
That three such graces did unto me give."
"Men call you fair, and you do credit it,
For that your self ye daily such do see:
But the true fair, that is the gentle wit,
And vertuous mind, is much more prais'd of me.
For all the rest, how ever fair it be,
Shall turn to naught and lose that glorious hue:
But only that is permanent and free
From frail corruption, that doth flesh ensue.
That is true beauty: that doth argue you
To be divine, and born of heavenly seed:
Deriv'd from that fair Spirit, from whom all true
And perfect beauty did at first proceed.
He only fair, and what he fair hath made,
All other fair, like flowers untimely fade."
"One day I wrote her name upon the strand,
But came the waves and washed it away:
Again I wrote it with a second hand,
But came the tide, and made my pains his prey.
""Vain man,"" said she, ""that dost in vain assay,
A mortal thing so to immortalize;
For I myself shall like to this decay,
And eke my name be wiped out likewise.""
""Not so,"" (quod I) ""let baser things devise
To die in dust, but you shall live by fame:
My verse your vertues rare shall eternize,
And in the heavens write your glorious name:
Where whenas death shall all the world subdue,
Our love shall live, and later life renew."""
"This holy season, fit to fast and pray,
Men to devotion ought to be inclin'd:
Therefore I likewise on so holy day,
For my sweet saint some service fit will find.
Her temple fair is built within my mind,
In which her glorious image placed is,
On which my thoughts do day and night attend,
Like sacred priests that never think amiss.
There I to her as th' author of my bliss,
Will build an altar to appease her ire:
And on the same my heart will sacrifice,
Burning in flames of pure and chaste desire:
The which vouchsafe, O goddess, to accept,
Amongst thy dearest relics to be kept."
"AH whither, Love, wilt thou now carry me?
What wontless fury dost thou now inspire
Into my feeble breast, too full of thee?
Whilst seeking to aslake thy raging fire,
Thou in me kindlest much more great desire,
And up aloft above my strength dost raise
The wondrous matter of my fire to praise.

That as I erst in praise of thine own name,
So now in honour of thy mother dear,
An honourable hymn I eke should frame,
And with the brightness of her beauty clear,
The ravish'd hearts of gazeful men might rear
To admiration of that heavenly light,
From whence proceeds such soul-enchanting might.

Thereto do thou, great goddess, queen of beauty,
Mother of love, and of all world's delight,
Without whose sovereign grace and kindly duty
Nothing on earth seems fair to fleshly sight,
Do thou vouchsafe with thy love-kindling light
T' illuminate my dim and dulled eyne,
And beautify this sacred hymn of thine:

That both to thee, to whom I mean it most,
And eke to her, whose fair immortal beam
Hath darted fire into my feeble ghost,
That now it wasted is with woes extreme,
It may so please, that she at length will stream
Some dew of grace into my withered heart,
After long sorrow and consuming smart.

WHAT time this world's great Workmaster did cast
To make all things such as we now behold,
It seems that he before his eyes had plac'd
A goodly pattern, to whose perfect mould
He fashion'd them as comely as he could;
That now so fair and seemly they appear,
As nought may be amended anywhere.

That wondrous pattern, wheresoe'er it be,
Whether in earth laid up in secret store,
Or else in heaven, that no man may it see
With sinful eyes, for fear it to deflore,
Is perfect Beauty, which all men adore;
Whose face and feature doth so much excel
All mortal sense, that none the same may tell.

Thereof as every earthly thing partakes
Or more or less, by influence divine,
So it more fair accordingly it makes,
And the gross matter of this earthly mine,
Which clotheth it, thereafter doth refine,
Doing away the dross which dims the light
Of that fair beam which therein is empight.

For, through infusion of celestial power,
The duller earth it quick'neth with delight,
And lifeful spirits privily doth pour
Through all the parts, that to the looker's sight
They seem to please. That is thy sovereign might,
O Cyprian queen, which flowing from the beam
Of thy bright star, thou into them dost stream.

That is the thing which giveth pleasant grace
To all things fair, that kindleth lively fire,
Light of thy lamp, which, shining in the face,
Thence to the soul darts amorous desire,
And robs the hearts of those which it admire;
Therewith thou pointest thy son's poison'd arrow,
That wounds the life, and wastes the inmost marrow.

How vainly then do idle wits invent,
That beauty is nought else but mixture made
Of colours fair, and goodly temp'rament
Of pure complexions, that shall quickly fade
And pass away, like to a summer's shade;
Or that it is but comely composition
Of parts well measur'd, with meet disposition.

Hath white and red in it such wondrous power,
That it can pierce through th' eyes unto the heart,
And therein stir such rage and restless stour,
As nought but death can stint his dolour's smart?
Or can proportion of the outward part
Move such affection in the inward mind,
That it can rob both sense and reason blind?

Why do not then the blossoms of the field,
Which are array'd with much more orient hue,
And to the sense most dainty odours yield,
Work like impression in the looker's view?
Or why do not fair pictures like power shew,
In which oft-times we nature see of art
Excell'd, in perfect limning every part?

But ah, believe me, there is more than so,
That works such wonders in the minds of men;
I, that have often prov'd, too well it know,
And whoso list the like assays to ken,
Shall find by trial, and confess it then,
That beauty is not, as fond men misdeem,
An outward shew of things, that only seem.

For that same goodly hue of white and red,
With which the cheeks are sprinkled, shall decay,
And those sweet rosy leaves, so fairly spread
Upon the lips, shall fade and fall away
To that they were, even to corrupted clay;
That golden wire, those sparkling stars so bright,
Shall turn to dust; and lose their goodly light.

But that fair lamp, from whose celestial ray
That light proceeds, which kindleth lovers' fire,
Shall never be extinguish'd nor decay;
But when the vital spirits do expire,
Unto her native planet shall retire;
For it is heavenly born and cannot die,
Being a parcel of the purest sky.

For when the soul, the which derived was,
At first, out of that great immortal Spright,
By whom all live to love, whilom did pass
Down from the top of purest heaven's height
To be embodied here, it then took light
And lively spirits from that fairest star,
Which lights the world forth from his fiery car.

Which power retaining still or more or less,
When she in fleshly seed is eft enraced,
Through every part she doth the same impress,
According as the heavens have her graced,
And frames her house, in which she will be placed,
Fit for herself, adorning it with spoil
Of th' heavenly riches which she robb'd erewhile.

Thereof it comes that these fair souls, which have
The most resemblance of that heavenly light,
Frame to themselves most beautiful and brave
Their fleshly bower, most fit for their delight,
And the gross matter by a sovereign might
Tempers so trim, that it may well be seen
A palace fit for such a virgin queen.

So every spirit, as it is most pure,
And hath in it the more of heavenly light,
So it the fairer body doth procure
To habit in, and it more fairly dight
With cheerful grace and amiable sight.
For of the soul the body form doth take:
For soul is form, and doth the body make.

Therefore wherever that thou dost behold
A comely corpse, with beauty fair endued,
Know this for certain, that the same doth hold
A beauteous soul, with fair conditions thewed,
Fit to receive the seed of virtue strewed.
For all that fair is, is by nature good;
That is a sign to know the gentle blood.

Yet oft it falls that many a gentle mind
Dwells in deformed tabernacle drown'd,
Either by chance, against the course of kind,
Or through unaptness in the substance found,
Which it assumed of some stubborn ground,
That will not yield unto her form's direction,
But is deform'd with some foul imperfection.

And oft it falls, (ay me, the more to rue)
That goodly beauty, albe heavenly born,
Is foul abus'd, and that celestial hue,
Which doth the world with her delight adorn,
Made but the bait of sin, and sinners' scorn,
Whilst every one doth seek and sue to have it,
But every one doth seek but to deprave it.

Yet nathemore is that fair beauty's blame,
But theirs that do abuse it unto ill:
Nothing so good, but that through guilty shame
May be corrupt, and wrested unto will:
Natheless the soul is fair and beauteous still,
However flesh{""e}s fault it filthy make;
For things immortal no corruption take.

But ye fair dames, the world's dear ornaments
And lively images of heaven's light,
Let not your beams with such disparagements
Be dimm'd, and your bright glory dark'ned quite;
But mindful still of your first country's sight,
Do still preserve your first informed grace,
Whose shadow yet shines in your beauteous face.

Loathe that foul blot, that hellish firebrand,
Disloyal lust, fair beauty's foulest blame,
That base affections, which your ears would bland,
Commend to you by love's abused name,
But is indeed the bondslave of defame;
Which will the garland of your glory mar,
And quench the light of your bright shining star.

But gentle Love, that loyal is and true,
Will more illumine your resplendent ray,
And add more brightness to your goodly hue,
From light of his pure fire; which, by like way
Kindled of yours, your likeness doth display;
Like as two mirrors, by oppos'd reflection,
Do both express the face's first impression.

Therefore, to make your beauty more appear,
It you behoves to love, and"
"And wilt thou leave me thus?
Say nay, say nay, for shame,
To save thee from the blame
Of all my grief and grame;
And wilt thou leave me thus?
Say nay, say nay!

And wilt thou leave me thus,
That hath loved thee so long
In wealth and woe among?
And is thy heart so strong
As for to leave me thus?
Say nay, say nay!

And wilt thou leave me thus,
That hath given thee my heart
Never for to depart,
Nother for pain nor smart;
And wilt thou leave me thus?
Say nay, say nay!

And wilt thou leave me thus
And have no more pity
Of him that loveth thee?
Helas, thy cruelty!
And wilt thou leave me thus?
Say nay, say nay!"
"Loving in truth, and fain in verse my love to show,
That she, dear she, might take some pleasure of my pain,
Pleasure might cause her read, reading might make her know,
Knowledge might pity win, and pity grace obtain,
I sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe;
Studying inventions fine her wits to entertain,
Oft turning others' leaves, to see if thence would flow
Some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sunburn'd brain.
But words came halting forth, wanting invention's stay;
Invention, Nature's child, fled step-dame Study's blows;
And others' feet still seem'd but strangers in my way.
Thus great with child to speak and helpless in my throes,
Biting my truant pen, beating myself for spite,
""Fool,"" said my Muse to me, ""look in thy heart, and write."""
"You that do search for every purling spring
Which from the ribs of old Parnassus flows,
And every flower, not sweet perhaps, which grows
Near thereabouts, into your poesy wring;
Ye that do dictionary's method bring
Into your rimes, running in rattling rows;
You that poor Petrarch's long-deceased woes
With new-born sighs and denizen'd wit do sing:
You take wrong ways; those far-fet helps be such
As do bewray a want of inward touch,
And sure, at length stol'n goods do come to light.
But if, both for your love and skill, your name
You seek to nurse at fullest breasts of Fame,
Stella behold, and then begin to endite."
"Fly, fly, my friends, I have my death wound, fly!
See there that boy, that murd'ring boy, I say,
Who, like a thief, hid in dark bush doth lie
Till bloody bullet get him wrongful prey.
So tyrant he no fitter place could spy,
Nor so fair level in so secret stay,
As that sweet black which veils the heav'nly eye;
There himself with his shot he close doth lay.
Poor passenger, pass now thereby I did,
And stay'd, pleas'd with the prospect of the place,
While that black hue from me the bad guest hid;
But straight I saw motions of lightning grace
And then descried the glist'ring of his dart:
But ere I could fly thence it pierc'd my heart."
"The curious wits, seeing dull pensiveness
Bewray itself in my long-settl'd eyes,
Whence those same fumes of melancholy rise,
With idle pains and missing aim do guess.
Some, that know how my spring I did address,
Deem that my Muse some fruit of knowledge plies;
Others, because the prince my service tries,
Think that I think state errors to redress;
But harder judges judge ambition's ragei
Scourge of itself, still climbing slipp'ry placei
Holds my young brain captiv'd in golden cage.
O fool or over-wise! alas, the race
Of all my thoughts hath neither stop nor start
But only Stella's eyes and Stella's heart."
"Let dainty wits cry on the sisters nine,
That, bravely mask'd, their fancies may be told;
Or, Pindar's apes, flaunt they in phrases fine,
Enam'ling with pied flowers their thoughts of gold.
Or else let them in statelier glory shine,
Ennobling newfound tropes with problems old;
Or with strange similes enrich each line,
Of herbs or beasts which Ind or Afric hold.
For me, in sooth, no Muse but one I know;
Phrases and problems from my reach do grow,
And strange things cost too dear for my poor sprites.
How then? even thus: in Stella's face I read
What love and beauty be; then all my deed
But copying is, what in her Nature writes."
"With how sad steps, O Moon, thou climb'st the skies!
How silently, and with how wan a face!
What, may it be that even in heav'nly place
That busy archer his sharp arrows tries!
Sure, if that long-with love-acquainted eyes
Can judge of love, thou feel'st a lover's case,
I read it in thy looks; thy languish'd grace
To me, that feel the like, thy state descries.
Then, ev'n of fellowship, O Moon, tell me,
Is constant love deem'd there but want of wit?
Are beauties there as proud as here they be?
Do they above love to be lov'd, and yet
Those lovers scorn whom that love doth possess?
Do they call virtue there ungratefulness?"
"I might!unhappy wordO me, I might,
And then would not, or could not, see my bliss;
Till now wrapt in a most infernal night,
I find how heav'nly day, wretch! I did miss.
Heart, rend thyself, thou dost thyself but right;
No lovely Paris made thy Helen his,
No force, no fraud robb'd thee of thy delight,
Nor Fortune of thy fortune author is;
But to myself myself did give the blow,
While too much wit, forsooth, so troubled me
That I respects for both our sakes must show:
And yet could not by rising morn foresee
How fair a day was near: O punish'd eyes,
That I had been more foolish,or more wise!"
"Come Sleep! O Sleep, the certain knot of peace,
The baiting-place of wit, the balm of woe,
The poor man's wealth, the prisoner's release,
Th' indifferent judge between the high and low.
With shield of proof shield me from out the prease
Of those fierce darts despair at me doth throw:
O make in me those civil wars to cease;
I will good tribute pay, if thou do so.
Take thou of me smooth pillows, sweetest bed,
A chamber deaf to noise and blind to light,
A rosy garland and a weary head:
And if these things, as being thine by right,
Move not thy heavy grace, thou shalt in me,
Livelier than elsewhere, Stella's image see."
"Having this day my horse, my hand, my lance
Guided so well that I obtain'd the prize,
Both by the judgment of the English eyes
And of some sent from that sweet enemy France;
Horsemen my skill in horsemanship advance,
Town folks my strength; a daintier judge applies
His praise to sleight which from good use doth rise;
Some lucky wits impute it but to chance;
Others, because of both sides I do take
My blood from them who did excel in this,
Think Nature me a man of arms did make.
How far they shot awry! The true cause is,
Stella look'd on, and from her heav'nly face
Sent forth the beams which made so fair my race."
"No more, my dear, no more these counsels try;
Oh, give my passions leave to run their race;
Let Fortune lay on me her worst disgrace;
Let folk o'ercharg'd with brain against me cry;
Let clouds bedim my face, break in mine eye;
Let me no steps but of lost labour trace;
Let all the earth with scorn recount my case,
But do not will me from my love to fly.
I do not envy Aristotle's wit,
Nor do aspire to Caesar's bleeding fame;
Nor aught do care though some above me sit;
Nor hope nor wish another course to frame,
But that which once may win thy cruel heart:
Thou art my wit, and thou my virtue art."
"When Nature made her chief work, Stella's eyes,
In colour black why wrapt she beams so bright?
Would she in beamy black, like painter wise,
Frame daintiest lustre, mix'd of shades and light?
Or did she else that sober hue devise,
In object best to knit and strength our sight;
Lest, if no veil these brave gleams did disguise,
They, sunlike, should more dazzle than delight?
Or would she her miraculous power show,
That, whereas black seems beauty's contrary,
She even in black doth make all beauties flow?
Both so, and thus, she, minding Love should be
Plac'd ever there, gave him this mourning weed
To honour all their deaths who for her bleed."
"Who will in fairest book of nature know
How virtue may best lodg'd in beauty be,
Let him but learn of love to read in thee,
Stella, those fair lines which true goodness show.
There shall he find all vices' overthrow,
Not by rude force, but sweetest sovereignty
Of reason, from whose light those night-birds fly;
That inward sun in thine eyes shineth so.
And, not content to be perfection's heir
Thyself, dost strive all minds that way to move,
Who mark in thee what is in thee most fair.
So while thy beauty draws thy heart to love,
As fast thy virtue bends that love to good:
But ""Ah,"" Desire still cries, ""Give me some food!"""
"Highway, since you my chief Parnassus be,
And that my Muse, to some ears not unsweet,
Tempers her words to trampling horses' feet
More oft than to a chamber melody.
Now, blessed you bear onward blessed me
To her, where I my heart, safe-left, shall meet:
My Muse and I must you of duty greet
With thanks and wishes, wishing thankfully.
Be you still fair, honour'd by public heed;
By no encroachment wrong'd, nor time forgot,
Nor blam'd for blood, nor sham'd for sinful deed;
And that you know I envy you no lot
Of highest wish, I wish you so much bliss,i
Hundreds of years you Stella's feet may kiss."
"Be your words made, good sir, of Indian ware,
That you allow me them by so small rate?
Or do you cutted Spartans imitate?
Or do you mean my tender ears to spare,
That to my questions you so total are?
When I demand of Phoenix Stella's state,
You say, forsooth, you left her well of late:
O God, think you that satisfies my care?
I would know whether she did sit or walk;
How cloth'd, how waited on; sigh'd she, or smil'd;
Whereof, with whom, how often did she talk;
With what pastime time's journey she beguiled;
If her lips deign'd to sweeten my poor name.
Say all; and all well said, still say the same."
"Avising the bright beams of these fair eyes
Where he is that mine oft moisteth and washeth,
The wearied mind straight from the heart departeth
For to rest in his worldly paradise
And find the sweet bitter under this guise.
What webs he hath wrought well he perceiveth
Whereby with himself on love he plaineth
That spurreth with fire and bridleth with ice.
Thus is it in such extremity brought,
In frozen thought, now and now it standeth in flame.
Twixt misery and wealth, twixt earnest and game,
But few glad, and many diverse thought
With sore repentance of his hardiness.
Of such a root cometh fruit fruitless."
"Come live with me, and be my love,
And we will some new pleasures prove
Of golden sands, and crystal brooks,
With silken lines, and silver hooks.

There will the river whispering run
Warm'd by thy eyes, more than the sun;
And there the 'enamour'd fish will stay,
Begging themselves they may betray.

When thou wilt swim in that live bath,
Each fish, which every channel hath,
Will amorously to thee swim,
Gladder to catch thee, than thou him.

If thou, to be so seen, be'st loth,
By sun or moon, thou dark'nest both,
And if myself have leave to see,
I need not their light having thee.

Let others freeze with angling reeds,
And cut their legs with shells and weeds,
Or treacherously poor fish beset,
With strangling snare, or windowy net.

Let coarse bold hands from slimy nest
The bedded fish in banks out-wrest;
Or curious traitors, sleeve-silk flies,
Bewitch poor fishes' wand'ring eyes.

For thee, thou need'st no such deceit,
For thou thyself art thine own bait:
That fish, that is not catch'd thereby,
Alas, is wiser far than I."
"For God's sake hold your tongue, and let me love,
         Or chide my palsy, or my gout,
My five gray hairs, or ruined fortune flout,
         With wealth your state, your mind with arts improve,
                Take you a course, get you a place,
                Observe his honor, or his grace,
Or the king's real, or his stamped face
         Contemplate; what you will, approve,
         So you will let me love.

Alas, alas, who's injured by my love?
         What merchant's ships have my sighs drowned?
Who says my tears have overflowed his ground?
         When did my colds a forward spring remove?
                When did the heats which my veins fill
                Add one more to the plaguy bill?
Soldiers find wars, and lawyers find out still
         Litigious men, which quarrels move,
         Though she and I do love.

Call us what you will, we are made such by love;
         Call her one, me another fly,
We're tapers too, and at our own cost die,
         And we in us find the eagle and the dove.
                The phnix riddle hath more wit
                By us; we two being one, are it.
So, to one neutral thing both sexes fit.
         We die and rise the same, and prove
         Mysterious by this love.

We can die by it, if not live by love,
         And if unfit for tombs and hearse
Our legend be, it will be fit for verse;
         And if no piece of chronicle we prove,
                We'll build in sonnets pretty rooms;
                As well a well-wrought urn becomes
The greatest ashes, as half-acre tombs,
         And by these hymns, all shall approve
         Us canonized for Love.

And thus invoke us: ""You, whom reverend love
         Made one another's hermitage;
You, to whom love was peace, that now is rage;
         Who did the whole world's soul contract, and drove
                Into the glasses of your eyes
                (So made such mirrors, and such spies,
That they did all to you epitomize)
         Countries, towns, courts: beg from above
         A pattern of your love!"""
"Let it not your wonder move,
Less your laughter, that I love.
Though I now write fifty years,
I have had, and have, my peers;
Poets, though divine, are men,
Some have lov'd as old again.
And it is not always face,
Clothes, or fortune, gives the grace;
Or the feature, or the youth.
But the language and the truth,
With the ardour and the passion,
Gives the lover weight and fashion.
If you then will read the story,
First prepare you to be sorry
That you never knew till now
Either whom to love or how;
But be glad, as soon with me,
When you know that this is she
Of whose beauty it was sung;
She shall make the old man young,
Keep the middle age at stay,
And let nothing high decay,
Till she be the reason why
All the world for love may die."
"See the chariot at hand here of Love,
Wherein my lady rideth!
Each that draws is a swan or a dove,
And well the car Love guideth.
As she goes, all hearts do duty
Unto her beauty;
And enamour'd, do wish, so they might
But enjoy such a sight,
That they still were to run by her side,
Through swords, through seas, whither she would ride.

Do but look on her eyes, they do light
All that Love's world compriseth!
Do but look on her hair, it is bright
As Love's star when it riseth!
Do but mark, her forehead's smoother
Than words that soothe her;
And from her arched brows, such a grace
Sheds itself through the face
As alone there triumphs to the life
All the gain, all the good, of the elements' strife.

Have you seen but a bright lily grow,
Before rude hands have touch'd it?
Ha' you mark'd but the fall o' the snow
Before the soil hath smutch'd it?
Ha' you felt the wool o' the beaver?
Or swan's down ever?
Or have smelt o' the bud o' the briar?
Or the nard in the fire?
Or have tasted the bag of the bee?
Oh so white! Oh so soft! Oh so sweet is she!"
"Muses that sing love's sensual empery,
And lovers kindling your enraged fires
At Cupid's bonfires burning in the eye,
Blown with the empty breath of vain desires;
You that prefer the painted cabinet
Before the wealthy jewels it doth store ye,
That all your joys in dying figures set,
And stain the living substance of your glory;
Abjure those joys, abhor their memory,
And let my love the honour'd subject be
Of love, and honour's complete history.
Your eyes were never yet let in to see
The majesty and riches of the mind,
But dwell in darkness; for your god is blind."
"Dear love, for nothing less than thee
Would I have broke this happy dream;
            It was a theme
For reason, much too strong for fantasy,
Therefore thou wak'd'st me wisely; yet
My dream thou brok'st not, but continued'st it.
Thou art so true that thoughts of thee suffice
To make dreams truths, and fables histories;
Enter these arms, for since thou thought'st it best,
Not to dream all my dream, let's act the rest.

   As lightning, or a taper's light,
Thine eyes, and not thy noise wak'd me;
            Yet I thought thee
(For thou lovest truth) an angel, at first sight;
But when I saw thou sawest my heart,
And knew'st my thoughts, beyond an angel's art,
When thou knew'st what I dreamt, when thou knew'st when
Excess of joy would wake me, and cam'st then,
I must confess, it could not choose but be
Profane, to think thee any thing but thee.

   Coming and staying show'd thee, thee,
But rising makes me doubt, that now
            Thou art not thou.
That love is weak where fear's as strong as he;
'Tis not all spirit, pure and brave,
If mixture it of fear, shame, honour have;
Perchance as torches, which must ready be,
Men light and put out, so thou deal'st with me;
Thou cam'st to kindle, goest to come; then I
Will dream that hope again, but else would die."
"Where, like a pillow on a bed
         A pregnant bank swell'd up to rest
The violet's reclining head,
         Sat we two, one another's best.
Our hands were firmly cemented
         With a fast balm, which thence did spring;
Our eye-beams twisted, and did thread
         Our eyes upon one double string;
So to'intergraft our hands, as yet
         Was all the means to make us one,
And pictures in our eyes to get
         Was all our propagation.
As 'twixt two equal armies fate
         Suspends uncertain victory,
Our souls (which to advance their state
         Were gone out) hung 'twixt her and me.
And whilst our souls negotiate there,
         We like sepulchral statues lay;
All day, the same our postures were,
         And we said nothing, all the day.
If any, so by love refin'd
         That he soul's language understood,
And by good love were grown all mind,
         Within convenient distance stood,
He (though he knew not which soul spake,
         Because both meant, both spake the same)
Might thence a new concoction take
         And part far purer than he came.
This ecstasy doth unperplex,
         We said, and tell us what we love;
We see by this it was not sex,
         We see we saw not what did move;
But as all several souls contain
         Mixture of things, they know not what,
Love these mix'd souls doth mix again
         And makes both one, each this and that.
A single violet transplant,
         The strength, the colour, and the size,
(All which before was poor and scant)
         Redoubles still, and multiplies.
When love with one another so
         Interinanimates two souls,
That abler soul, which thence doth flow,
         Defects of loneliness controls.
We then, who are this new soul, know
         Of what we are compos'd and made,
For th' atomies of which we grow
         Are souls, whom no change can invade.
But oh alas, so long, so far,
         Our bodies why do we forbear?
They'are ours, though they'are not we; we are
         The intelligences, they the spheres.
We owe them thanks, because they thus
         Did us, to us, at first convey,
Yielded their senses' force to us,
         Nor are dross to us, but allay.
On man heaven's influence works not so,
         But that it first imprints the air;
So soul into the soul may flow,
            Though it to body first repair.
As our blood labors to beget
         Spirits, as like souls as it can,
Because such fingers need to knit
         That subtle knot which makes us man,
So must pure lovers' souls descend
         T' affections, and to faculties,
Which sense may reach and apprehend,
         Else a great prince in prison lies.
To'our bodies turn we then, that so
         Weak men on love reveal'd may look;
Love's mysteries in souls do grow,
         But yet the body is his book.
And if some lover, such as we,
         Have heard this dialogue of one,
Let him still mark us, he shall see
         Small change, when we'are to bodies gone."
"No spring nor summer beauty hath such grace
         As I have seen in one autumnal face.
Young beauties force our love, and that's a rape,
         This doth but counsel, yet you cannot scape.
If 'twere a shame to love, here 'twere no shame;
         Affection here takes reverence's name.
Were her first years the golden age? That's true,
         But now she's gold oft tried and ever new.
That was her torrid and inflaming time,
         This is her tolerable tropic clime.
Fair eyes, who asks more heat than comes from hence,
         He in a fever wishes pestilence.
Call not these wrinkles, graves; if graves they were,
         They were Love's graves, for else he is no where.
Yet lies not Love dead here, but here doth sit
         Vow'd to this trench, like an anachorit;
And here till hers, which must be his death, come,
         He doth not dig a grave, but build a tomb.
Here dwells he; though he sojourn ev'rywhere
         In progress, yet his standing house is here:
Here where still evening is, not noon nor night,
         Where no voluptuousness, yet all delight.
In all her words, unto all hearers fit,
         You may at revels, you at council, sit.
This is Love's timber, youth his underwood;
         There he, as wine in June, enrages blood,
Which then comes seasonabliest when our taste
         And appetite to other things is past.
Xerxes' strange Lydian love, the platan tree,
         Was lov'd for age, none being so large as she,
Or else because, being young, nature did bless
         Her youth with age's glory, barrenness.
If we love things long sought, age is a thing
         Which we are fifty years in compassing;
If transitory things, which soon decay,
         Age must be loveliest at the latest day.
But name not winter faces, whose skin's slack,
         Lank as an unthrift's purse, but a soul's sack;
Whose eyes seek light within, for all here's shade;
         Whose mouths are holes, rather worn out than made;
Whose every tooth to a several place is gone,
         To vex their souls at resurrection:
Name not these living death's-heads unto me,
         For these, not ancient, but antique be.
I hate extremes, yet I had rather stay
         With tombs than cradles, to wear out a day.
Since such love's natural lation is, may still
         My love descend, and journey down the hill,
Not panting after growing beauties. So,
         I shall ebb on with them who homeward go."
"Here take my picture; though I bid farewell
Thine, in my heart, where my soul dwells, shall dwell.
'Tis like me now, but I dead, 'twill be more
When we are shadows both, than 'twas before.
When weather-beaten I come back, my hand
Perhaps with rude oars torn, or sun beams tann'd,
My face and breast of haircloth, and my head
With care's rash sudden storms being o'erspread,
My body'a sack of bones, broken within,
And powder's blue stains scatter'd on my skin;
If rival fools tax thee to'have lov'd a man
So foul and coarse as, oh, I may seem then,
This shall say what I was, and thou shalt say,
""Do his hurts reach me? doth my worth decay?
Or do they reach his judging mind, that he
Should now love less, what he did love to see?
That which in him was fair and delicate,
Was but the milk which in love's childish state
Did nurse it; who now is grown strong enough
To feed on that, which to disus'd tastes seems tough."""
"""Who is it that this dark night
Underneath my window plaineth?""
It is one who from thy sight
Being, ah, exil'd, disdaineth
Every other vulgar light.

""Why, alas, and are you he?
Be not yet those fancies changed?""
Dear, when you find change in me,
Though from me you be estranged,
Let my change to ruin be.

""Well, in absence this will die;
Leave to see, and leave to wonder.""
Absence sure will help, if I
Can learn how myself to sunder
From what in my heart doth lie.

""But time will these thoughts remove;
Time doth work what no man knoweth.""
Time doth as the subject prove;
With time still the affection groweth
In the faithful turtle-dove.

""What if you new beauties see?
Will not they stir new affection?""
I will think they pictures be,
Image-like, of saints' perfection,
Poorly counterfeiting thee.

""But your reason's purest light
Bids you leave such minds to nourish.""
Dear, do reason no such spite;
Never doth thy beauty flourish
More than in my reason's sight.

""But the wrongs love bears will make
Love at length leave undertaking.""
No, the more fools it do shake,
In a ground of so firm making
Deeper still they drive the stake.

""Peace, I think that some give ear!
Come no more, lest I get anger!""
Bliss, I will my bliss forbear;
Fearing, sweet, you to endanger;
But my soul shall harbour there.

""Well, begone; begone, I say,
Lest that Argus' eyes perceive you!""
Oh, unjust Fortune's sway,
Which can make me thus to leave you;
And from louts to run away."
"Farewell love and all thy laws forever;
Thy baited hooks shall tangle me no more.
Senec and Plato call me from thy lore
To perfect wealth, my wit for to endeavour.
In blind error when I did persever,
Thy sharp repulse, that pricketh aye so sore,
Hath taught me to set in trifles no store
And scape forth, since liberty is lever.
Therefore farewell; go trouble younger hearts
And in me claim no more authority.
With idle youth go use thy property
And thereon spend thy many brittle darts,
For hitherto though I have lost all my time,
Me lusteth no lenger rotten boughs to climb."
"Follow thy fair sun, unhappy shadow,
Though thou be black as night
And she made all of light,
Yet follow thy fair sun unhappy shadow.

Follow her whose light thy light depriveth,
Though here thou livst disgraced,
And she in heaven is placed,
Yet follow her whose light the world reviveth.

Follow those pure beams whose beauty burneth,
That so have scorched thee,
As thou still black must be,
Till Her kind beams thy black to brightness turneth.

Follow her while yet her glory shineth,
There comes a luckless night,
That will dim all her light,
And this the black unhappy shade divineth.

Follow still since so thy fates ordained,
The Sun must have his shade,
Till both at once do fade,
The Sun still proved, the shadow still disdained.




Poetry Out Loud Note: In the print anthology, this poem is titled ""Follow thy fair sun, unhappy shadow."" The student may give either title during the recitation."
"Follow your saint, follow with accents sweet;
Haste you, sad notes, fall at her flying feet.
There, wrapp'd in cloud of sorrow, pity move,
And tell the ravisher of my soul I perish for her love:
But if she scorns my never-ceasing pain,
Then burst with sighing in her sight and ne'er return again.

All that I sung still to her praise did tend,
Still she was first; still she my songs did end;
Yet she my love and music both doth fly,
The music that her echo is and beauty's sympathy.
Then let my notes pursue her scornful flight:
It shall suffice that they were breath'd and died for her delight."
"Forget not yet the tried intent
Of such a truth as I have meant;
My great travail so gladly spent,
            Forget not yet.

   Forget not yet when first began
The weary life ye know, since whan
The suit, the service, none tell can;
            Forget not yet.

   Forget not yet the great assays,
The cruel wrong, the scornful ways;
The painful patience in denays,
            Forget not yet.

   Forget not yet, forget not this,
How long ago hath been and is
The mind that never meant amiss;
            Forget not yet.

   Forget not then thine own approved,
The which so long hath thee so loved,
Whose steadfast faith yet never moved;
            Forget not this."
"Whoever comes to shroud me, do not harm
         Nor question much
That subtle wreath of hair, which crowns my arm;
The mystery, the sign, you must not touch,
         For 'tis my outward soul,
Viceroy to that, which then to heaven being gone,
         Will leave this to control
And keep these limbs, her provinces, from dissolution.

For if the sinewy thread my brain lets fall
         Through every part
Can tie those parts, and make me one of all,
Those hairs which upward grew, and strength and art
         Have from a better brain,
Can better do'it; except she meant that I
         By this should know my pain,
As prisoners then are manacled, when they'are condemn'd to die.

Whate'er she meant by'it, bury it with me,
         For since I am
Love's martyr, it might breed idolatry,
If into other hands these relics came;
         As 'twas humility
To afford to it all that a soul can do,
         So, 'tis some bravery,
That since you would have none of me, I bury some of you."
"I wonder, by my troth, what thou and I
Did, till we loved? Were we not weaned till then?
But sucked on country pleasures, childishly?
Or snorted we in the Seven Sleepers den?
Twas so; but this, all pleasures fancies be.
If ever any beauty I did see,
Which I desired, and got, twas but a dream of thee.

And now good-morrow to our waking souls,
Which watch not one another out of fear;
For love, all love of other sights controls,
And makes one little room an everywhere.
Let sea-discoverers to new worlds have gone,
Let maps to other, worlds on worlds have shown,
Let us possess one world, each hath one, and is one.

My face in thine eye, thine in mine appears,
And true plain hearts do in the faces rest;
Where can we find two better hemispheres,
Without sharp north, without declining west?
Whatever dies, was not mixed equally;
If our two loves be one, or, thou and I
Love so alike, that none do slacken, none can die."
"The heart and service to you proffer'd
With right good will full honestly,
Refuse it not, since it is offer'd,
But take it to you gentlely.

And though it be a small present,
Yet good, consider graciously
The thought, the mind, and the intent
Of him that loves you faithfully.

It were a thing of small effect
To work my woe thus cruelly,
For my good will to be abject:
Therefore accept it lovingly.

Pain or travel, to run or ride,
I undertake it pleasantly;
Bid ye me go, and straight I glide
At your commandement humbly.

Pain or pleasure, now may you plant
Even which it please you steadfastly;
Do which you list, I shall not want
To be your servant secretly.

And since so much I do desire
To be your own assuredly,
For all my service and my hire
Reward your servant liberally."
"On Hellespont, guilty of true love's blood,
In view and opposite two cities stood,
Sea-borderers, disjoin'd by Neptune's might;
The one Abydos, the other Sestos hight.
At Sestos Hero dwelt; Hero the fair,
Whom young Apollo courted for her hair,
And offer'd as a dower his burning throne,
Where she could sit for men to gaze upon.
The outside of her garments were of lawn,
The lining purple silk, with gilt stars drawn;
Her wide sleeves green, and border'd with a grove,
Where Venus in her naked glory strove
To please the careless and disdainful eyes
Of proud Adonis, that before her lies;
Her kirtle blue, whereon was many a stain,
Made with the blood of wretched lovers slain.
Upon her head she ware a myrtle wreath,
From whence her veil reach'd to the ground beneath;
Her veil was artificial flowers and leaves,
Whose workmanship both man and beast deceives;
Many would praise the sweet smell as she past,
When 'twas the odour which her breath forth cast;
And there for honey bees have sought in vain,
And beat from thence, have lighted there again.
About her neck hung chains of pebble-stone,
Which lighten'd by her neck, like diamonds shone.
She ware no gloves; for neither sun nor wind
Would burn or parch her hands, but, to her mind,
Or warm or cool them, for they took delight
To play upon those hands, they were so white.
Buskins of shells, all silver'd, used she,
And branch'd with blushing coral to the knee;
Where sparrows perch'd, of hollow pearl and gold,
Such as the world would wonder to behold:
Those with sweet water oft her handmaid fills,
Which as she went, would chirrup through the bills.
Some say, for her the fairest Cupid pin'd,
And looking in her face, was strooken blind.
But this is true; so like was one the other,
As he imagin'd Hero was his mother;
And oftentimes into her bosom flew,
About her naked neck his bare arms threw,
And laid his childish head upon her breast,
And with still panting rock'd there took his rest.
So lovely-fair was Hero, Venus' nun,
As Nature wept, thinking she was undone,
Because she took more from her than she left,
And of such wondrous beauty her bereft:
Therefore, in sign her treasure suffer'd wrack,
Since Hero's time hath half the world been black.

         Amorous Leander, beautiful and young
(Whose tragedy divine Musus sung),
Dwelt at Abydos; since him dwelt there none
For whom succeeding times make greater moan.
His dangling tresses, that were never shorn,
Had they been cut, and unto Colchos borne,
Would have allur'd the vent'rous youth of Greece
To hazard more than for the golden fleece.
Fair Cynthia wish'd his arms might be her sphere;
Grief makes her pale, because she moves not there.
His body was as straight as Circe's wand;
Jove might have sipt out nectar from his hand.
Even as delicious meat is to the taste,
So was his neck in touching, and surpast
The white of Pelops' shoulder: I could tell ye,
How smooth his breast was, and how white his belly;
And whose immortal fingers did imprint
That heavenly path with many a curious dint
That runs along his back; but my rude pen
Can hardly blazon forth the loves of men,
Much less of powerful gods: let it suffice
That my slack Muse sings of Leander's eyes;
Those orient cheeks and lips, exceeding his
That leapt into the water for a kiss
Of his own shadow, and, despising many,
Died ere he could enjoy the love of any.
Had wild Hippolytus Leander seen,
Enamour'd of his beauty had he been.
His presence made the rudest peasant melt,
That in the vast uplandish country dwelt;
The barbarous Thracian soldier, mov'd with nought,
Was mov'd with him, and for his favour sought.
Some swore he was a maid in man's attire,
For in his looks were all that men desire,
A pleasant smiling cheek, a speaking eye,
A brow for love to banquet royally;
And such as knew he was a man, would say,
""Leander, thou art made for amorous play;
Why art thou not in love, and lov'd of all?
Though thou be fair, yet be not thine own thrall.""

         The men of wealthy Sestos every year,
For his sake whom their goddess held so dear,
Rose-cheek'd Adonis, kept a solemn feast.
Thither resorted many a wandering guest
To meet their loves; such as had none at all
Came lovers home from this great festival;
For every street, like to a firmament,
Glister'd with breathing stars, who, where they went,
Frighted the melancholy earth, which deem'd
Eternal heaven to burn, for so it seem'd
As if another Pha{""e}ton had got
The guidance of the sun's rich chariot.
But far above the loveliest, Hero shin'd,
And stole away th' enchanted gazer's mind;
For like sea-nymphs' inveigling harmony,
So was her beauty to the standers-by;
Nor that night-wandering, pale, and watery star
(When yawning dragons draw her thirling car
From Latmus' mount up to the gloomy sky,
Where, crown'd with blazing light and majesty,
She proudly sits) more over-rules the flood
Than she the hearts of those that near her stood.
Even as when gaudy nymphs pursue the chase,
Wretched Ixion's shaggy-footed race,
Incens'd with savage heat, gallop amain
From steep pine-bearing mountains to the plain,
So ran the people forth to gaze upon her,
And all that view'd her were enamour'd on her.
And as in fury of a dreadful fight,
Their fellows being slain or put to flight,
Poor soldiers stand with fear of death dead-strooken,
So at her presence all surpris'd and tooken,
Await the sentence of her scornful eyes;
He whom she favours lives; the other dies.
There might you see one sigh, another rage,
And some, their violent passions to assuage,
Compile sharp satires; but, alas, too late,
For faithful love will never turn to hate.
And many, seeing great princes were denied,
Pin'd as they went, and thinking on her, died.
On this feast-dayO cursed day and hour!
Went Hero thorough Sestos, from her tower
To Venus' temple, where unhappily,
As after chanc'd, they did each other spy.
So fair a church as this had Venus none:
The walls were of discolour'd jasper-stone,
Wherein was Proteus carved; and over-head
A lively vine of green sea-agate spread,
Where by one hand light-headed Bacchus hung,
And with the other wine from grapes out-wrung.
Of crystal shining fair the pavement was;
The town of Sestos call'd it Venus' glass:
There might you see the gods in sundry shapes,
Committing heady riots, incest, rapes:
For know, that underneath this radiant flower
Was Danae's statue in a brazen tower,
Jove slyly stealing from his sister's bed,
To dally with Idalian Ganimed,
And for his love Europa bellowing loud,
And tumbling with the rainbow in a cloud;
Blood-quaffing Mars heaving the iron net,
Which limping Vulcan and his Cyclops set;
Love kindling fire, to burn such towns as Troy,
Sylvanus weeping for the lovely boy
That now is turn'd into a cypress tree,
Under whose shade the wood-gods love to be.
And in the midst a silver altar stood:
There Hero, sacrificing turtles' blood,
Vail'd to the ground, veiling her eyelids close;
And modestly they opened as she rose.
Thence flew Love's arrow with the golden head;
And thus Leander was enamoured.
Stone-still he stood, and evermore he gazed,
Till with the fire that from his count'nance blazed
Relenting Hero's gentle heart was strook:
Such force and virtue hath an amorous look.

         It lies not in our power to love or hate,
For will in us is over-rul'd by fate.
When two are stript, long ere the course begin,
We wish that one should lose, the other win;
And one especially do we affect
Of two gold ingots, like in each respect:
The reason no man knows, let it suffice,
What we behold is censur'd by our eyes.
Where both deliberate, the love is slight:
Who ever lov'd, that lov'd not at first sight?"
"Show me dear Christ, thy spouse so bright and clear.
What! is it she which on the other shore
Goes richly painted? or which, robb'd and tore,
Laments and mourns in Germany and here?
Sleeps she a thousand, then peeps up one year?
Is she self-truth, and errs? now new, now outwore?
Doth she, and did she, and shall she evermore
On one, on seven, or on no hill appear?
Dwells she with us, or like adventuring knights
First travel we to seek, and then make love?
Betray, kind husband, thy spouse to our sights,
And let mine amorous soul court thy mild Dove,
Who is most true and pleasing to thee then
When she'is embrac'd and open to most men."
"Since she whom I lov'd hath paid her last debt
To nature, and to hers, and my good is dead,
And her soul early into heaven ravished,
Wholly in heavenly things my mind is set.
Here the admiring her my mind did whet
To seek thee, God; so streams do show the head;
But though I have found thee, and thou my thirst hast fed,
A holy thirsty dropsy melts me yet.
But why should I beg more love, whenas thou
Dost woo my soul, for hers off'ring all thine,
And dost not only fear lest I allow
My love to saints and angels, things divine,
But in thy tender jealousy dost doubt
Lest the world, flesh, yea devil put thee out."
"I find no peace, and all my war is done.
I fear and hope. I burn and freeze like ice.
I fly above the wind, yet can I not arise;
And nought I have, and all the world I season.
That loseth nor locketh holdeth me in prison
And holdeth me notyet can I scape no wise
Nor letteth me live nor die at my device,
And yet of death it giveth me occasion.
Without eyen I see, and without tongue I plain.
I desire to perish, and yet I ask health.
I love another, and thus I hate myself.
I feed me in sorrow and laugh in all my pain;
Likewise displeaseth me both life and death,
And my delight is causer of this strife."
"Unhappy verse, the witness of my unhappy state,
Make thy self flutt'ring wings of thy fast flying
Thought, and fly forth unto my love, wheresoever she be:
Whether lying restless in heavy bed, or else
Sitting so cheerless at the cheerful board, or else
Playing alone careless on her heavenly virginals.
If in bed, tell her, that my eyes can take no rest:
If at board, tell her, that my mouth can eat no meat:
If at her virginals, tell her, I can hear no mirth.
Asked why? say: waking love suffereth no sleep:
Say that raging love doth appal the weak stomach:
Say, that lamenting love marreth the musical.
Tell her, that her pleasures were wont to lull me asleep:
Tell her, that her beauty was wont to feed mine eyes:
Tell her, that her sweet tongue was wont to make me mirth.
Now do I nightly waste, wanting my kindly rest:
Now do I daily starve, wanting my lively food:
Now do I always die, wanting thy timely mirth.
And if I waste, who will bewail my heavy chance?
And if I starve, who will record my cursed end?
And if I die, who will say: ""This was Immerito""?"
"I can love both fair and brown,
Her whom abundance melts, and her whom want betrays,
Her who loves loneness best, and her who masks and plays,
Her whom the country formed, and whom the town,
Her who believes, and her who tries,
Her who still weeps with spongy eyes,
And her who is dry cork, and never cries;
I can love her, and her, and you, and you,
I can love any, so she be not true.

Will no other vice content you?
Will it not serve your turn to do as did your mothers?
Or have you all old vices spent, and now would find out others?
Or doth a fear that men are true torment you?
O we are not, be not you so;
Let me, and do you, twenty know.
Rob me, but bind me not, and let me go.
Must I, who came to travail thorough you,
Grow your fixed subject, because you are true?

Venus heard me sigh this song,
And by love's sweetest part, variety, she swore,
She heard not this till now; and that it should be so no more.
She went, examined, and returned ere long,
And said, Alas! some two or three
Poor heretics in love there be,
Which think to stablish dangerous constancy.
But I have told them, Since you will be true,
You shall be true to them who are false to you."
"Leave me, O Love, which reachest but to dust;
And thou, my mind, aspire to higher things;
Grow rich in that which never taketh rust;
Whatever fades but fading pleasure brings.
Draw in thy beams and humble all thy might
To that sweet yoke where lasting freedoms be;
Which breaks the clouds and opens forth the light,
That both doth shine and give us sight to see.
O take fast hold; let that light be thy guide
In this small course which birth draws out to death,
And think how evil becometh him to slide,
Who seeketh heav'n, and comes of heav'nly breath.
Then farewell, world; thy uttermost I see:
Eternal Love, maintain thy life in me."
"Stand still, and I will read to thee
A lecture, love, in love's philosophy.
         These three hours that we have spent,
         Walking here, two shadows went
Along with us, which we ourselves produc'd.
But, now the sun is just above our head,
         We do those shadows tread,
         And to brave clearness all things are reduc'd.
So whilst our infant loves did grow,
Disguises did, and shadows, flow
From us, and our cares; but now 'tis not so.
That love has not attain'd the high'st degree,
Which is still diligent lest others see.

Except our loves at this noon stay,
We shall new shadows make the other way.
         As the first were made to blind
         Others, these which come behind
Will work upon ourselves, and blind our eyes.
If our loves faint, and westwardly decline,
         To me thou, falsely, thine,
         And I to thee mine actions shall disguise.
The morning shadows wear away,
But these grow longer all the day;
But oh, love's day is short, if love decay.
Love is a growing, or full constant light,
And his first minute, after noon, is night."
"The longe love that in my thought doth harbour
And in mine hert doth keep his residence,
Into my face presseth with bold pretence
And therein campeth, spreading his banner.
She that me learneth to love and suffer
And will that my trust and lustes negligence
Be rayned by reason, shame, and reverence,
With his hardiness taketh displeasure.
Wherewithall unto the hert's forest he fleeth,
Leaving his enterprise with pain and cry,
And there him hideth and not appeareth.
What may I do when my master feareth
But in the field with him to live and die?
For good is the life ending faithfully."
"Some that have deeper digg'd love's mine than I,
Say, where his centric happiness doth lie;
         I have lov'd, and got, and told,
But should I love, get, tell, till I were old,
I should not find that hidden mystery.
         Oh, 'tis imposture all!
And as no chemic yet th'elixir got,
         But glorifies his pregnant pot
         If by the way to him befall
Some odoriferous thing, or medicinal,
         So, lovers dream a rich and long delight,
         But get a winter-seeming summer's night.

Our ease, our thrift, our honour, and our day,
Shall we for this vain bubble's shadow pay?
         Ends love in this, that my man
Can be as happy'as I can, if he can
Endure the short scorn of a bridegroom's play?
         That loving wretch that swears
'Tis not the bodies marry, but the minds,
         Which he in her angelic finds,
         Would swear as justly that he hears,
In that day's rude hoarse minstrelsy, the spheres.
         Hope not for mind in women; at their best
         Sweetness and wit, they'are but mummy, possess'd."
"I long to talk with some old lover's ghost,
      Who died before the god of love was born.
I cannot think that he, who then lov'd most,
      Sunk so low as to love one which did scorn.
But since this god produc'd a destiny,
And that vice-nature, custom, lets it be,
      I must love her, that loves not me.

   Sure, they which made him god, meant not so much,
      Nor he in his young godhead practis'd it.
But when an even flame two hearts did touch,
      His office was indulgently to fit
Actives to passives. Correspondency
Only his subject was; it cannot be
      Love, till I love her, that loves me.

   But every modern god will now extend
      His vast prerogative as far as Jove.
To rage, to lust, to write to, to commend,
      All is the purlieu of the god of love.
O! were we waken'd by this tyranny
To ungod this child again, it could not be
      I should love her, who loves not me.

   Rebel and atheist too, why murmur I,
      As though I felt the worst that love could do?
Love might make me leave loving, or might try
      A deeper plague, to make her love me too;
Which, since she loves before, I'am loth to see.
Falsehood is worse than hate; and that must be,
      If she whom I love, should love me."
"If yet I have not all thy love,
Dear, I shall never have it all;
I cannot breathe one other sigh, to move,
Nor can intreat one other tear to fall;
And all my treasure, which should purchase thee
Sighs, tears, and oaths, and lettersI have spent.
Yet no more can be due to me,
Than at the bargain made was meant;
If then thy gift of love were partial,
That some to me, some should to others fall,
         Dear, I shall never have thee all.

Or if then thou gavest me all,
All was but all, which thou hadst then;
But if in thy heart, since, there be or shall
New love created be, by other men,
Which have their stocks entire, and can in tears,
In sighs, in oaths, and letters, outbid me,
This new love may beget new fears,
For this love was not vow'd by thee.
And yet it was, thy gift being general;
The ground, thy heart, is mine; whatever shall
         Grow there, dear, I should have it all.

Yet I would not have all yet,
He that hath all can have no more;
And since my love doth every day admit
New growth, thou shouldst have new rewards in store;
Thou canst not every day give me thy heart,
If thou canst give it, then thou never gavest it;
Love's riddles are, that though thy heart depart,
It stays at home, and thou with losing savest it;
But we will have a way more liberal,
Than changing hearts, to join them; so we shall
         Be one, and one another's all."
"Madam, withouten many words
    Once I am sure ye will or no ...
And if ye will, then leave your bourds
    And use your wit and show it so,
And with a beck ye shall me call;
    And if of one that burneth alway
Ye have any pity at all,
    Answer him fair with & {.} or nay.
If it be &, {.} I shall be fain;
    If it be nay, friends as before;
Ye shall another man obtain,
    And I mine own and yours no more."
"My lute awake! perform the last
Labour that thou and I shall waste,
And end that I have now begun;
For when this song is sung and past,
My lute be still, for I have done.

As to be heard where ear is none,
As lead to grave in marble stone,
My song may pierce her heart as soon;
Should we then sigh or sing or moan?
No, no, my lute, for I have done.

The rocks do not so cruelly
Repulse the waves continually,
As she my suit and affection;
So that I am past remedy,
Whereby my lute and I have done.

Proud of the spoil that thou hast got
Of simple hearts thorough Love's shot,
By whom, unkind, thou hast them won,
Think not he hath his bow forgot,
Although my lute and I have done.

Vengeance shall fall on thy disdain
That makest but game on earnest pain.
Think not alone under the sun
Unquit to cause thy lovers plain,
Although my lute and I have done.

Perchance thee lie wethered and old
The winter nights that are so cold,
Plaining in vain unto the moon;
Thy wishes then dare not be told;
Care then who list, for I have done.

And then may chance thee to repent
The time that thou hast lost and spent
To cause thy lovers sigh and swoon;
Then shalt thou know beauty but lent,
And wish and want as I have done.

Now cease, my lute; this is the last
Labour that thou and I shall waste,
And ended is that we begun.
Now is this song both sung and past:
My lute be still, for I have done."
"I now think Love is rather deaf than blind,
For else it could not be
That she,
Whom I adore so much, should so slight me
And cast my love behind.
I'm sure my language to her was as sweet,
And every close did meet
In sentence of as subtle feet,
As hath the youngest He
That sits in shadow of Apollo's tree.

O, but my conscious fears,
That fly my thoughts between,
Tell me that she hath seen
My hundred of gray hairs,
Told seven and forty years
Read so much waste, as she cannot embrace
My mountain belly and my rocky face;
And all these through her eyes have stopp'd her ears."
"Come live with me and be my love,
And we will all the pleasures prove,
That Valleys, groves, hills, and fields,
Woods, or steepy mountain yields.

And we will sit upon the Rocks,
Seeing the Shepherds feed their flocks,
By shallow Rivers to whose falls
Melodious birds sing Madrigals.

And I will make thee beds of Roses
And a thousand fragrant posies,
A cap of flowers, and a kirtle
Embroidered all with leaves of Myrtle;

A gown made of the finest wool
Which from our pretty Lambs we pull;
Fair lined slippers for the cold,
With buckles of the purest gold;

A belt of straw and Ivy buds,
With Coral clasps and Amber studs:
And if these pleasures may thee move,
Come live with me, and be my love.

The Shepherds Swains shall dance and sing
For thy delight each May-morning:
If these delights thy mind may move,
Then live with me, and be my love."
"When my grave is broke up again
       Some second guest to entertain,
       (For graves have learn'd that woman head,
       To be to more than one a bed)
                And he that digs it, spies
A bracelet of bright hair about the bone,
                Will he not let'us alone,
And think that there a loving couple lies,
Who thought that this device might be some way
To make their souls, at the last busy day,
Meet at this grave, and make a little stay?

         If this fall in a time, or land,
         Where mis-devotion doth command,
         Then he, that digs us up, will bring
         Us to the bishop, and the king,
                To make us relics; then
Thou shalt be a Mary Magdalen, and I
                A something else thereby;
All women shall adore us, and some men;
And since at such time miracles are sought,
I would have that age by this paper taught
What miracles we harmless lovers wrought.

         First, we lov'd well and faithfully,
         Yet knew not what we lov'd, nor why;
         Difference of sex no more we knew
         Than our guardian angels do;
                Coming and going, we
Perchance might kiss, but not between those meals;
                Our hands ne'er touch'd the seals
Which nature, injur'd by late law, sets free;
These miracles we did, but now alas,
All measure, and all language, I should pass,
Should I tell what a miracle she was."
"Ring out your bells, let mourning shows be spread;
For Love is dead
All love is dead, infected
With plague of deep disdain;
Worth, as nought worth, rejected,
And Faith fair scorn doth gain.
From so ungrateful fancy,
From such a female franzy,
From them that use men thus,
Good Lord, deliver us!

Weep, neighbours, weep; do you not hear it said
That Love is dead?
His death-bed, peacock's folly;
His winding-sheet is shame;
His will, false-seeming holy;
His sole exec'tor, blame.
From so ungrateful fancy,
From such a female franzy,
From them that use men thus,
Good Lord, deliver us!

Let dirge be sung and trentals rightly read,
For Love is dead;
Sir Wrong his tomb ordaineth
My mistress' marble heart,
Which epitaph containeth,
""Her eyes were once his dart.""
From so ungrateful fancy,
From such a female franzy,
From them that use men thus,
Good Lord, deliver us!

Alas, I lie, rage hath this error bred;
Love is not dead;
Love is not dead, but sleepeth
In her unmatched mind,
Where she his counsel keepeth,
Till due desert she find.
Therefore from so vile fancy,
To call such wit a franzy,
Who Love can temper thus,
Good Lord, deliver us!"
"Rose-cheek'd Laura, come,
Sing thou smoothly with thy beauty's
Silent music, either other
Sweetly gracing.

Lovely forms do flow
From concent divinely framed;
Heav'n is music, and thy beauty's
Birth is heavenly.

These dull notes we sing
Discords need for helps to grace them;
Only beauty purely loving
Knows no discord,

But still moves delight,
Like clear springs renew'd by flowing,
Ever perfect, ever in them-
Selves eternal."
"Since so ye please to hear me plain,
And that ye do rejoice my smart,
Me list no lenger to remain
To such as be so overthwart.

But cursed be that cruel heart
Which hath procurd a careless mind
For me and mine unfeigned smart,
And forceth me such faults to find.

More than too much I am assured
Of thine intent, whereto to trust;
A speedless proof I have endured,
And now I leave it to them that lust."
"My true-love hath my heart and I have his,
By just exchange one for the other given:
I hold his dear, and mine he cannot miss;
There never was a bargain better driven.
His heart in me keeps me and him in one;
My heart in him his thoughts and senses guides:
He loves my heart, for once it was his own;
I cherish his because in me it bides.
His heart his wound received from my sight;
My heart was wounded with his wounded heart;
For as from me on him his hurt did light,
So still, methought, in me his hurt did smart:
Both equal hurt, in this change sought our bliss,
My true love hath my heart and I have his."
"Go and catch a falling star,
    Get with child a mandrake root,
Tell me where all past years are,
    Or who cleft the devil's foot,
Teach me to hear mermaids singing,
Or to keep off envy's stinging,
            And find
            What wind
Serves to advance an honest mind.

If thou be'st born to strange sights,
    Things invisible to see,
Ride ten thousand days and nights,
    Till age snow white hairs on thee,
Thou, when thou return'st, wilt tell me,
All strange wonders that befell thee,
            And swear,
            No where
Lives a woman true, and fair.

If thou find'st one, let me know,
    Such a pilgrimage were sweet;
Yet do not, I would not go,
    Though at next door we might meet;
Though she were true, when you met her,
And last, till you write your letter,
            Yet she
            Will be
False, ere I come, to two, or three.





Poetry Out Loud Note: In the print anthology, this poem is titled simply ""Song."" The student may give either title during the recitation. "
"O Mistress mine where are you roaming?
O stay and hear, your true love's coming,
      That can sing both high and low.
Trip no further pretty sweeting.
Journeys end in lovers' meeting,
      Every wise man's son doth know.

What is love, 'tis not hereafter,
Present mirth, hath present laughter:
      What's to come, is still unsure.
In delay there lies no plenty,
Then come kiss me sweet and twenty:
      Youth's a stuff will not endure."
"Sweetest love, I do not go,
         For weariness of thee,
Nor in hope the world can show
         A fitter love for me;
                But since that I
Must die at last, 'tis best
To use myself in jest
         Thus by feign'd deaths to die.

Yesternight the sun went hence,
         And yet is here today;
He hath no desire nor sense,
         Nor half so short a way:
                Then fear not me,
But believe that I shall make
Speedier journeys, since I take
         More wings and spurs than he.

O how feeble is man's power,
         That if good fortune fall,
Cannot add another hour,
         Nor a lost hour recall!
                But come bad chance,
And we join to'it our strength,
And we teach it art and length,
         Itself o'er us to'advance.

When thou sigh'st, thou sigh'st not wind,
         But sigh'st my soul away;
When thou weep'st, unkindly kind,
         My life's blood doth decay.
                It cannot be
That thou lov'st me, as thou say'st,
If in thine my life thou waste,
         That art the best of me.

Let not thy divining heart
         Forethink me any ill;
Destiny may take thy part,
         And may thy fears fulfil;
                But think that we
Are but turn'd aside to sleep;
They who one another keep
         Alive, ne'er parted be."
"Take, oh take those lips away,
      That so sweetly were forsworn,
And those eyes: the breake of day,
      Lights that do mislead the Morn;
But my kisses bring again, bring again,
Seals of love, but sealed in vain, sealed in vain."
"Drink to me only with thine eyes,
         And I will pledge with mine;
Or leave a kiss but in the cup,
         And Ill not look for wine.
The thirst that from the soul doth rise
         Doth ask a drink divine;
But might I of Joves nectar sup,
         I would not change for thine.

I sent thee late a rosy wreath,
         Not so much honouring thee
As giving it a hope, that there
         It could not withered be.
But thou thereon didst only breathe,
         And sentst it back to me;
Since when it grows, and smells, I swear,
         Not of itself, but thee."
"When I consider everything that grows
Holds in perfection but a little moment,
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;
When I perceive that men as plants increase,
Cheered and check'd even by the selfsame sky,
Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
And wear their brave state out of memory;
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,
Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay
To change your day of youth to sullied night;
And all in war with Time for love of you,
As he takes from you, I engraft you new."
"Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,
And burn the long-liv'd Phoenix in her blood;
Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,
And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,
To the wide world and all her fading sweets;
But I forbid thee one more heinous crime:
O, carve not with the hours my love's fair brow,
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen!
Him in thy course untainted do allow
For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.
Yet do thy worst, old Time! Despite thy wrong
My love shall in my verse ever live young."
"Let those who are in favour with their stars
Of public honour and proud titles boast,
Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,
Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.
Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread
But as the marigold at the sun's eye,
And in themselves their pride lies buried,
For at a frown they in their glory die.
The painful warrior famoused for fight,
After a thousand victories once foil'd,
Is from the book of honour razed quite,
And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:
Then happy I, that love and am beloved
Where I may not remove nor be removed."
"When, in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes,
I all alone beweep my outcast state,
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
And look upon myself and curse my fate,
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,
Desiring this mans art and that mans scope,
With what I most enjoy contented least;
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,
Haply I think on thee, and then my state,
(Like to the lark at break of day arising
From sullen earth) sings hymns at heavens gate;
       For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
       That then I scorn to change my state with kings."
"When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
I summon up remembrance of things past,
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:
Then can I drown an eye, unus'd to flow,
For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,
And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,
And moan th' expense of many a vanish'd sight;
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,
Which I new pay as if not paid before.
But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,
All losses are restor'd, and sorrows end."
"If thou survive my well-contented day,
When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover,
And shalt by fortune once more re-survey
These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,
Compare them with the bettering of the time,
And though they be outstripp'd by every pen,
Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
Exceeded by the height of happier men.
O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:
""Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age
A dearer birth than this his love had brought,
To march in ranks of better equipage:
But since he died and poets better prove,
Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love."""
"Full many a glorious morning have I seen
Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,
Kissing with golden face the meadows green,
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
With ugly rack on his celestial face
And from the forlorn world his visage hide,
Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace.
Even so my sun one early morn did shine
With all-triumphant splendour on my brow;
But out, alack! he was but one hour mine;
The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.
Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;
Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth."
"What is your substance, whereof are you made,
That millions of strange shadows on you tend?
Since every one hath, every one, one shade,
And you, but one, can every shadow lend.
Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit
Is poorly imitated after you;
On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,
And you in Grecian tires are painted new.
Speak of the spring and foison of the year:
The one doth shadow of your beauty show,
The other as your bounty doth appear;
And you in every blessed shape we know.
    In all external grace you have some part,
    But you like none, none you, for constant heart."
"When I have seen by Time's fell hand defac'd
The rich proud cost of outworn buried age;
When sometime lofty towers I see down-ras'd
And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,
And the firm soil win of the wat'ry main,
Increasing store with loss and loss with store;
When I have seen such interchange of state,
Or state itself confounded to decay;
Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,
That Time will come and take my love away.
This thought is as a death, which cannot choose
But weep to have that which it fears to lose."
"Tir'd with all these, for restful death I cry,
As, to behold desert a beggar born,
And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,
And purest faith unhappily forsworn,
And gilded honour shamefully misplac'd,
And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,
And right perfection wrongfully disgrac'd,
And strength by limping sway disabled,
And art made tongue-tied by authority,
And folly, doctor-like, controlling skill,
And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,
And captive good attending captain ill.
Tir'd with all these, from these would I be gone,
Save that, to die, I leave my love alone."
"No longer mourn for me when I am dead
Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
Give warning to the world that I am fled
From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell; 
Nay, if you read this line, remember not
The hand that writ it; for I love you so, 
That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot, 
If thinking on me then should make you woe.
O, if (I say) you look upon this verse, 
When I (perhaps) compounded am with clay,
Do not so much as my poor name rehearse,
But let your love even with my life decay,
Lest the wise world should look into your moan, 
And mock you with me after I am gone."
"That time of year thou mayst in me behold
When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.
In me thou see'st the twilight of such day
As after sunset fadeth in the west,
Which by and by black night doth take away,
Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.
In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
As the death-bed whereon it must expire,
Consum'd with that which it was nourish'd by.
This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,
To love that well which thou must leave ere long."
"Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul
Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,
Can yet the lease of my true love control,
Suppos'd as forfeit to a confin'd doom.
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd
And the sad augurs mock their own presage;
Incertainties now crown themselves assur'd
And peace proclaims olives of endless age.
Now with the drops of this most balmy time
My love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes,
Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme,
While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes;
And thou in this shalt find thy monument,
When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent."
"Alas, 'tis true I have gone here and there
And made myself a motley to the view,
Gor'd mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,
Made old offences of affections new.
Most true it is that I have look'd on truth
Askance and strangely: but, by all above,
These blenches gave my heart another youth,
And worse essays prov'd thee my best of love.
Now all is done, have what shall have no end!
Mine appetite, I never more will grind
On newer proof, to try an older friend,
A god in love, to whom I am confin'd.
Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,
Even to thy pure and most most loving breast."
"Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments. Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds,
Or bends with the remover to remove.
O no! it is an ever-fixed mark
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
It is the star to every wand'ring bark,
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
Within his bending sickle's compass come;
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
If this be error and upon me prov'd,
I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd."
"Th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame
Is lust in action; and till action, lust
Is perjured, murd'rous, bloody, full of blame,
Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,
Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight,
Past reason hunted; and, no sooner had
Past reason hated as a swallowed bait
On purpose laid to make the taker mad;
Mad in pursuit and in possession so,
Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;
A bliss in proof and proved, a very woe;
Before, a joy proposed; behind, a dream.
    All this the world well knows; yet none knows well
    To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell."
"My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
Coral is far more red than her lips' red;
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
I have seen roses damasked, red and white,
But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
And in some perfumes is there more delight
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
That music hath a far more pleasing sound;
I grant I never saw a goddess go;
My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground.
   And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare
   As any she belied with false compare."
"Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,
[......] these rebel powers that thee array,
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?
Why so large cost, having so short a lease,
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?
Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,
Eat up thy charge? Is this thy body's end?
Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss
And let that pine to aggravate thy store;
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;
Within be fed, without be rich no more.
So shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,
And, Death once dead, there's no more dying then."
"Still to be neat, still to be dressed,
As you were going to a feast;
Still to be powdered, still perfumed; 
Lady, it is to be presumed,
Though art's hid causes are not found,
All is not sweet, all is not sound.

Give me a look, give me a face,
That makes simplicity a grace;
Robes loosely flowing, hair as free;
Such sweet neglect more taketh me
                       Than all th'adulteries of art. 
They strike mine eyes, but not my heart."
"               Busy old fool, unruly sun,
               Why dost thou thus,
Through windows, and through curtains call on us?
Must to thy motions lovers' seasons run?
               Saucy pedantic wretch, go chide
               Late school boys and sour prentices,
         Go tell court huntsmen that the king will ride,
         Call country ants to harvest offices,
Love, all alike, no season knows nor clime,
Nor hours, days, months, which are the rags of time.

               Thy beams, so reverend and strong
               Why shouldst thou think?
I could eclipse and cloud them with a wink,
But that I would not lose her sight so long;
               If her eyes have not blinded thine,
               Look, and tomorrow late, tell me,
         Whether both th' Indias of spice and mine
         Be where thou leftst them, or lie here with me.
Ask for those kings whom thou saw'st yesterday,
And thou shalt hear, All here in one bed lay.

               She's all states, and all princes, I,
               Nothing else is.
Princes do but play us; compared to this,
All honor's mimic, all wealth alchemy.
               Thou, sun, art half as happy as we,
               In that the world's contracted thus.
         Thine age asks ease, and since thy duties be
         To warm the world, that's done in warming us.
Shine here to us, and thou art everywhere;
This bed thy center is, these walls, thy sphere."
"There is a garden in her face
Where roses and white lilies grow;
A heav'nly paradise is that place
Wherein all pleasant fruits do flow.
There cherries grow which none may buy,
Till ""Cherry ripe"" themselves do cry.

Those cherries fairly do enclose
Of orient pearl a double row,
Which when her lovely laughter shows,
They look like rose-buds fill'd with snow;
Yet them nor peer nor prince can buy,
Till ""Cherry ripe"" themselves do cry.

Her eyes like angels watch them still,
Her brows like bended bows do stand,
Threat'ning with piercing frowns to kill
All that attempt with eye or hand
Those sacred cherries to come nigh,
Till ""Cherry ripe"" themselves do cry."
"They flee from me that sometime did me seek
With naked foot, stalking in my chamber.
I have seen them gentle, tame, and meek,
That now are wild and do not remember
That sometime they put themself in danger
To take bread at my hand; and now they range,
Busily seeking with a continual change.

Thanked be fortune it hath been otherwise
Twenty times better; but once in special,
In thin array after a pleasant guise,
When her loose gown from her shoulders did fall,
And she me caught in her arms long and small;
Therewithall sweetly did me kiss
And softly said, Dear heart, how like you this?

It was no dream: I lay broad waking.
But all is turned thorough my gentleness
Into a strange fashion of forsaking;
And I have leave to go of her goodness,
And she also, to use newfangleness.
But since that I so kindly am served
I would fain know what she hath deserved."
"Thrice toss these oaken ashes in the air,
Thrice sit thou mute in this enchanted chair,
Then thrice three times tie up this true love's knot,
And murmur soft ""She will, or she will not.""

Go burn these pois'nous weeds in yon blue fire,
These screech-owl's feathers and this prickling briar,
This cypress gathered at a dead man's grave,
That all my fears and cares an end may have.

Then come, you fairies! dance with me a round;
Melt her hard heart with your melodious sound.
In vain are all the charms I can devise:
She hath an art to break them with her eyes."
"   Unstable dream, according to the place,
Be steadfast once, or else at least be true.
By tasted sweetness make me not to rue
The sudden loss of thy false feigned grace.
By good respect in such a dangerous case
Thou broughtest not her into this tossing mew
But madest my sprite live, my care to renew,
My body in tempest her succour to embrace.
The body dead, the sprite had his desire,
Painless was th'one, th'other in delight.
Why then, alas, did it not keep it right,
Returning, to leap into the fire?
     And where it was at wish, it could not remain,
     Such mocks of dreams they turn to deadly pain."
"As virtuous men pass mildly away,
   And whisper to their souls to go,
Whilst some of their sad friends do say
   The breath goes now, and some say, No:

So let us melt, and make no noise,
   No tear-floods, nor sigh-tempests move;
'Twere profanation of our joys
   To tell the laity our love.

Moving of th' earth brings harms and fears,
   Men reckon what it did, and meant;
But trepidation of the spheres,
   Though greater far, is innocent.

Dull sublunary lovers' love
   (Whose soul is sense) cannot admit
Absence, because it doth remove
   Those things which elemented it.

But we by a love so much refined,
   That our selves know not what it is,
Inter-assured of the mind,
   Care less, eyes, lips, and hands to miss.

Our two souls therefore, which are one,
   Though I must go, endure not yet
A breach, but an expansion,
   Like gold to airy thinness beat.

If they be two, they are two so
   As stiff twin compasses are two;
Thy soul, the fixed foot, makes no show
   To move, but doth, if the other do.

And though it in the center sit,
   Yet when the other far doth roam,
It leans and hearkens after it,
   And grows erect, as that comes home.

Such wilt thou be to me, who must,
   Like th' other foot, obliquely run;
Thy firmness makes my circle just,
   And makes me end where I begun."
"          Let me pour forth
My tears before thy face, whilst I stay here,
For thy face coins them, and thy stamp they bear,
And by this mintage they are something worth,
         For thus they be
         Pregnant of thee;
Fruits of much grief they are, emblems of more,
When a tear falls, that thou falls which it bore,
So thou and I are nothing then, when on a diverse shore.

         On a round ball
A workman that hath copies by, can lay
An Europe, Afric, and an Asia,
And quickly make that, which was nothing, all;
         So doth each tear
         Which thee doth wear,
A globe, yea world, by that impression grow,
Till thy tears mix'd with mine do overflow
This world; by waters sent from thee, my heaven dissolved so.

         O more than moon,
Draw not up seas to drown me in thy sphere,
Weep me not dead, in thine arms, but forbear
To teach the sea what it may do too soon;
         Let not the wind
         Example find,
To do me more harm than it purposeth;
Since thou and I sigh one another's breath,
Whoe'er sighs most is cruellest, and hastes the other's death."
"What needeth these threnning words and wasted wind?
All this cannot make me restore my prey.
To rob your good, iwis, is not my mind,
Nor causeless your fair hand did I display.
Let love be judge or else whom next we meet
That may both hear what you and I can say:
She took from me an heart, and I a glove from her.
Let us see now if th'one be worth th'other."
"What should I say,
Since faith is dead,
And truth away
From you is fled?
Should I be led
With doubleness?
Nay, nay, mistress!

I promised you,
And you promised me,
To be as true
As I would be.
But since I see
Your double heart,
Farewell my part!

Though for to take
It is not my mind,
But to forsake
[One so unkind]
And as I find,
So will I trust:
Farewell, unjust!

Can ye say nay?
But you said
That I alway
Should be obeyed?
And thus betrayed
Or that I wiste
Farewell, unkissed."
"When thou must home to shades of underground,
And there arriv'd, a new admired guest,
The beauteous spirits do engirt thee round,
White Iope, blithe Helen, and the rest,
To hear the stories of thy finish'd love
From that smooth tongue whose music hell can move;

Then wilt thou speak of banqueting delights,
Of masques and revels which sweet youth did make,
Of tourneys and great challenges of knights,
And all these triumphs for thy beauty's sake:
When thou hast told these honours done to thee,
Then tell, O tell, how thou didst murder me."
"Whoso list to hunt, I know where is an hind,
But as for me, helas, I may no more.
The vain travail hath wearied me so sore,
I am of them that farthest cometh behind.
Yet may I by no means my wearied mind
Draw from the deer, but as she fleeth afore
Fainting I follow. I leave off therefore,
Sithens in a net I seek to hold the wind.
Who list her hunt, I put him out of doubt,
As well as I may spend his time in vain.
And graven with diamonds in letters plain
There is written, her fair neck round about:
Noli me tangere, for Caesar's I am,
And wild for to hold, though I seem tame."
"Ye old mule that think yourself so fair,
Leave off with craft your beauty to repair,
For it is true, without any fable,
No man setteth more by riding in your saddle.
Too much travail so do your train appair.
        Ye old mule
With false savour though you deceive th'air,
Whoso taste you shall well perceive your lair
Savoureth somewhat of a Kappurs stable.
        Ye old mule
Ye must now serve to market and to fair,
All for the burden, for panniers a pair.
For since gray hairs been powdered in your sable,
The thing ye seek for, you must yourself enable
To purchase it by payment and by prayer,
        Ye old mule."
"I leaned against the mantel, sick, sick,
Thinking of my failure, looking into the abysm,
Weak from the noon-day heat.
A church bell sounded mournfully far away,
I heard the cry of a baby,
And the coughing of John Yarnell,
Bed-ridden, feverish, feverish, dying,
Then the violent voice of my wife:
""Watch out, the potatoes are burning!""
I smelled them ... then there was irresistible disgust.
I pulled the trigger ... blackness ... light ...
Unspeakable regret ... fumbling for the world again.
Too late! Thus I came here,
With lungs for breathing ... one cannot breathe here with lungs,
Though one must breathe
Of what use is it To rid one's self of the world,
When no soul may ever escape the eternal destiny of life?"
"I was the first fruits of the battle of Missionary Ridge.
When I felt the bullet enter my heart
I wished I had staid at home and gone to jail
For stealing the hogs of Curl Trenary,
Instead of running away and joining the army.
Rather a thousand times the county jail
Than to lie under this marble figure with wings,
And this granite pedestal Bearing the words, Pro Patria.
What do they mean, anyway?"
"I was only eight years old;
And before I grew up and knew what it meant
I had no words for it, except
That I was frightened and told my
Mother; And that my Father got a pistol
And would have killed Charlie, who was a big boy,
Fifteen years old, except for his Mother.
Nevertheless the story clung to me.
But the man who married me, a widower of thirty-five,
Was a newcomer and never heard it
Till two years after we were married.
Then he considered himself cheated,
And the village agreed that I was not really a virgin.
Well, he deserted me, and I died
The following winter."

"Why should I blame her that she filled my days
With misery, or that she would of late
Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways,
Or hurled the little streets upon the great,
Had they but courage equal to desire?
What could have made her peaceful with a mind
That nobleness made simple as a fire,
With beauty like a tightened bow, a kind
That is not natural in an age like this,
Being high and solitary and most stern?
Why, what could she have done, being what she is?
Was there another Troy for her to burn?"
"I 
GLOOM! 
An October like November; 
August a hundred thousand hours, 
And all September, 
A hundred thousand, dragging sunlit days, 
And half October like a thousand years . . . 
And doom! 
That then was Antwerp. . . 
                              In the name of God, 
How could they do it? 
Those souls that usually dived 
Into the dirty caverns of mines; 
Who usually hived 
In whitened hovels; under ragged poplars; 
Who dragged muddy shovels, over the grassy mud, 
Lumbering to work over the greasy sods. . . 
Those men there, with the appearance of clods 
Were the bravest men that a usually listless priest of God 
Ever shrived. . . 
And it is not for us to make them an anthem. 
If we found words there would come no wind that would fan them 
To a tune that the trumpets might blow it, 
Shrill through the heaven that's ours or yet Allah's, 
Or the wide halls of any Valhallas. 
We can make no such anthem. So that all that is ours 
For inditing in sonnets, pantoums, elegiacs, or lays 
Is this: 
In the name of God, how could they do it? 


II 
For there is no new thing under the sun, 
Only this uncomely man with a smoking gun 
In the gloom. . . 
What the devil will he gain by it? 
Digging a hole in the mud and standing all day in the rain by it 
Waiting his doom; 
The sharp blow, the swift outpouring of the blood, 
Till the trench of gray mud 
Is turned to a brown purple drain by it. 
Well, there have been scars 
Won in many wars . . .
Punic, 
Lacedmonian, wars of Napoleon, wars for faith, wars for honour, for love, for possession, 
But this Belgian man in his ugly tunic, 
His ugly round cap, shooting on, in a sort of obsession, 
Overspreading his miserable land, 
Standing with his wet gun in his hand . . . 
Doom! 
He finds that in a sudden scrimmage, 
And lies, an unsightly lump on the sodden grass . . . 
An image that shall take long to pass! 


III 
For the white-limbed heroes of Hellas ride by upon their horses 
Forever through our brains. 
The heroes of Cressy ride by upon their stallions; 
And battalions and battalions and battalions 
The Old Guard, the Young Guard, the men of Minden and of Waterloo, 
Pass, for ever staunch, 
Stand, for ever true; 
And the small man with the large paunch, 
And the gray coat, and the large hat, and the hands behind the back, 
Watches them pass 
In our minds for ever . . . 
But that clutter of sodden corses 
On the sodden Belgian grass 
That is a strange new beauty. 


IV 
With no especial legends of marchings or triumphs or duty, 
Assuredly that is the way of it, 
The way of beauty . . . 
And that is the highest word you can find to say of it. 
For you cannot praise it with words 
Compounded of lyres and swords, 
But the thought of the gloom and the rain 
And the ugly coated figure, standing beside a drain, 
Shall eat itself into your brain: 
And you will say of all heroes, They fought like the Belgians! 
And you will say: He wrought like a Belgian his fate out of gloom. 
And you will say: He bought like a Belgian his doom. 
And that shall be an honourable name; 
Belgian shall be an honourable word; 
As honourable as the fame of the sword, 
As honourable as the mention of the many-chorded lyre, 
And his old coat shall seem as beautiful as the fabrics woven in Tyre. 


V 
And what in the world did they bear it for? 
I don't know. 
And what in the world did they dare it for? 
Perhaps that is not for the likes of me to understand. 
They could very well have watched a hundred legions go 
Over their fields and between their cities 
Down into more southerly regions. 
They could very well have let the legions pass through their woods, 
And have kept their lives and their wives and their children and cattle and goods. 
I don't understand. 
Was it just love of their land? 
Oh, poor dears! 
Can any man so love his land? 
Give them a thousand thousand pities 
And rivers and rivers of tears 
To wash off the blood from the cities of Flanders. 


VI 
This is Charing Cross; 
It is midnight; 
There is a great crowd 
And no light. 
A great crowd, all black that hardly whispers aloud. 
Surely, that is a dead womana dead mother! 
She has a dead face; 
She is dressed all in black; 
She wanders to the bookstall and back, 
At the back of the crowd; 
And back again and again back, 
She sways and wanders. 

This is Charing Cross; 
It is one o'clock. 
There is still a great cloud, and very little light; 
Immense shafts of shadows over the black crowd 
That hardly whispers aloud. . . 
And now! .  . That is another dead mother, 
And there is another and another and another. . . 
And little children, all in black, 
All with dead faces, waiting in all the waiting-places, 
Wandering from the doors of the waiting-room 
In the dim gloom. 
These are the women of Flanders.
They await the lost. 
They await the lost that shall never leave the dock; 
They await the lost that shall never again come by the train 
To the embraces of all these women with dead faces; 
They await the lost who lie dead in trench and barrier and foss, 
In the dark of the night. 
This is Charing Cross; it is past one of the clock; 
There is very little light. 

There is so much pain. 


LEnvoi 
And it was for this that they endured this gloom; 
This October like November, 
That August like a hundred thousand hours, 
And that September, 
A hundred thousand dragging sunlit days, 
And half October like a thousand years. . . 
Oh, poor dears!"
"As I went up by Ovillers
   In mud and water cold to the knee,
There went three jeering, fleering spectres,
   That walked abreast and talked of me.
 
The first said, Heres a right brave soldier
   That walks the dark unfearingly;
Soon hell come back on a fine stretcher,
   And laughing for a nice Blighty.
 
The second, Read his face, old comrade,
   No kind of lucky chance I see;
One day hell freeze in mud to the marrow,
   Then look his last on Picardie.
 
Though bitter the word of these first twain
   Curses the third spat venomously;
Hell stay untouched till the wars last dawning
   Then live one hour of agony.
 
Liars the first two were. Behold me
   At sloping arms by one  two  three;
Waiting the time I shall discover
   Whether the third spake verity."
"She was a village
Of lovely knowledge
The high roads left her aside, she was forlorn, a maid 
Water ran there, dusk hid her, she climbed four-wayed.
Brown-gold windows showed last folk not yet asleep;
Water ran, was a centre of silence deep,
Fathomless deeps of pricked sky, almost fathomless
Hallowed an upward gaze in pale satin of blue.
And I was happy indeed, of mind, soul, body even
Having got given
A sign undoubtful of a dear England few
Doubt, not many have seen,
That Will Squele he knew and was so shriven.
Home of Twelfth Night  Edward Thomas by Arras fallen,
Borrow and Hardy, Sussex tales out of Roman heights callen.
No madrigals or field-songs to my all reverent whim;
Till I got back I was dumb."
"If it were not for England, who would bear
This heavy servitude one moment more?
To keep a brothel, sweep and wash the floor
Of filthiest hovels were noble to compare
With this brass-cleaning life. Now here, now there
Harried in foolishness, scanned curiously o'er
By fools made brazen by conceit, and store
Of antique witticisms thin and bare.

Only the love of comrades sweetens all,
Whose laughing spirit will not be outdone.
As night-watching men wait for the sun
To hearten them, so wait I on such boys
As neither brass nor Hell-fire may appal,
Nor guns, nor sergeant-major's bluster and noise."
"Only the wanderer
   Knows England's graces,
Or can anew see clear
   Familiar faces.

And who loves joy as he
   That dwells in shadows?
Do not forget me quite,
   O Severn meadows."
"Little did I dream, England, that you bore me
Under the Cotswold hills beside the water meadows,
To do you dreadful service, here, beyond your borders
And your enfolding seas.
 
I was a dreamer ever, and bound to your dear service,
Meditating deep, I thought on your secret beauty,
As through a child's face one may see the clear spirit
Miraculously shining.
 
Your hills not only hills, but friends of mine and kindly,
Your tiny knolls and orchards hidden beside the river
Muddy and strongly flowing, with shy and tiny streamlets
Safe in its bosom.
 
Now these are memories only, and your skies and rushy sky-pools
Fragile mirrors easily broken by moving airs ...
But deep in my heart for ever goes on your daily being,
And uses consecrate.
 
Think on me too, O Mother, who wrest my soul to serve you
In strange and fearful ways beyond your encircling waters;
None but you can know my heart, its tears and sacrifice;
None, but you, repay."
"He's gone, and all our plans
   Are useless indeed.
We'll walk no more on Cotswold
   Where the sheep feed
   Quietly and take no heed.
 
His body that was so quick
   Is not as you
Knew it, on Severn river
   Under the blue
   Driving our small boat through.
 
You would not know him now ...
   But still he died
Nobly, so cover him over
   With violets of pride
   Purple from Severn side.
 
Cover him, cover him soon!
   And with thick-set
Masses of memoried flowers
   Hide that red wet
   Thing I must somehow forget."
"Now, youth, the hour of thy dread passion comes;
Thy lovely things must all be laid away;
And thou, as others, must face the riven day
Unstirred by rattle of the rolling drums,
Or bugles' strident cry. When mere noise numbs
The sense of being, the sick soul doth sway,
Remember thy great craft's honour, that they may say
Nothing in shame of poets. Then the crumbs
Of praise the little versemen joyed to take
Shall be forgotten; then they must know we are,
For all our skill in words, equal in might
And strong of mettle as those we honoured; make
The name of poet terrible in just war,
And like a crown of honour upon the fight."
"When I remember plain heroic strength
And shining virtue shown by Ypres pools,
Then read the blither written by knaves for fools
In praise of English soldiers lying at length,
Who purely dream what England shall be made
Gloriously new, free of the old stains
By us, who pay the price that must be paid,
Will freeze all winter over Ypres plains.
Our silly dreams of peace you put aside
And brotherhood of man, for you will see
An armed mistress, braggart of the tide,
Her children slaves, under your mastery.
We'll have a word there too, and forge a knife,
Will cut the cancer threatens England's life."

"   So in Pieria, from the wedded bliss
Of Time and Memory, the Muses came
To be the means of rich oblivion,
And rest from cares.  And when the Thunderer
Took heaven, then the Titans warred on him
For pity of mankind. But the great law,
Which is the law of music, not of bread,
Set Atlas for a pillar, manacled
His brother to the rocks of the Scythia,
And under Aetna fixed the furious Typhon.
So should thought rule, not force. And Amphion,
Pursuing justice, entered Thebes and slew
His mother's spouse; but when he would make sure
And fortify the city, then he took
The lyre that Hermes gave, and played, and watched
The stones move and assemble, till a wall
Engirded Thebes and kept the citadel
Beyond the reach of arrows and of fire.
What other power but harmony can build
A city, and what gift so magical
As that by which a city lifts its walls?
So men, in years to come, shall feel the power
Of this man moving through the high-ranged thought
Which plans for beauty, builds for larger life.
The stones shall rise in towers to answer him."
"My bands of silk and miniver
Momently grew heavier;
The black gauze was beggarly thin;
The ermine muffled mouth and chin;
I could not suck the moonlight in.

Harlequin in lozenges
Of love and hate, I walked in these
Striped and ragged rigmaroles;
Along the pavement my footsoles
Trod warily on living coals.

Shouldering the thoughts I loathed,
In their corrupt disguises clothed,
Morality I could not tear
From my ribs, to leave them bare
Ivory in silver air.

There I walked, and there I raged;
The spiritual savage caged
Within my skeleton, raged afresh
To feel, behind a carnal mesh,
The clean bones crying in the flesh."
"                                    I

Behoild Pelides with his yellow hair,
Proud child of Thetis, hero loved of Jove;
Above the frowning of his brows of wove
A crown of gold, well combed, with Spartan care.
Who might have seen him, sullen, great, and fair,
As with the wrongful world he proudly strove,
And by high deeds his wilder passion shrove,
Mastering love, resentment, and despair.
He knew his end, and Phoebus arrow sure
He braved for fame immortal and a friend,
Despising life; and we, who know our end,
Know that in our decay he shall endure
And all our childrens hearts to grief inure,
With whose first bitter battles his shall blend.

                                    II

Who brought thee forth, immortal vision, who
In Phthia or in Tempe brought thee forth?
Out of the sunlight and the sapful earth
What god the simples of thy spirit drew?
A goddess rose from the green waves, and threw
Her arms about a king, to give thee birth;
A centaur, patron of thy boyish mirth,
Over the meadows in thy footsteps flew.
Now Thessaly forgets thee, and the deep
Thy keeled bark furrowed answers not thy prayer;
But far away new generations keep
Thy laurels fresh; where branching Isis hems
The lawns of Oxford round about, or where
Enchanted Eton sits by pleasant Thames.

                                    III

I gaze on thee as Phidias of old
Or Polyclitus gazed, when first he saw
These hard and shining limbs, without a flaw,
And cast his wonder in heroic mould.
Unhappy me who only may behold,
Nor make immutable and fix in awe
A fair immortal form no worm shall gnaw,
A tempered mind whose faith was never told!
The godlike mien, the lions lock and eye,
The well-knit sinew, utter a brave heart
Better than many words that part by part
Spell in strange symbols what serene and whole
In nature lives, nor can in marble die.
The perfect body itself the soul."

"I had come to the house, in a cave of trees,
Facing a sheer sky.
Everything moved,a bell hung ready to strike,
Sun and reflection wheeled by.

When the bare eyes were before me
And the hissing hair,
Held up at a window, seen through a door.
The stiff bald eyes, the serpents on the forehead
Formed in the air.

This is a dead scene forever now.
Nothing will ever stir.
The end will never brighten it more than this,
Nor the rain blur.

The water will always fall, and will not fall,
And the tipped bell make no sound.
The grass will always be growing for hay
Deep on the ground.

And I shall stand here like a shadow
Under the great balanced day,
My eyes on the yellow dust, that was lifting in the wind,
And does not drift away."
"There may be chaos still around the world,
This little world that in my thinking lies;
For mine own bosom is the paradise
Where all my lifes fair visions are unfurled.
Within my natures shell I slumber curled,
Unmindful of the changing outer skies,
Where now, perchance, some new-born Eros flies,
Or some old Cronos from his throne is hurled.
I heed them not; or if the subtle night
Haunt me with deities I never saw,
I soon mine eyelids drowsy curtain draw
To hide their myriad faces from my sight.
They threat in vain; the whirlwind cannot awe
A happy snow-flake dancing in the flaw."

Another's a half-cracked fellowJohn Heydon,
Worker of miracles, dealer in levitation,
In thoughts upon pure form, in alchemy,
Seer of pretty visions (""servant of God and secretary of nature"");         
Full of plaintive charm, like Botticelli's,
With half-transparent forms, lacking the vigor of gods.
Thus Heydon, in a trance, at Bulverton,
Had such a sight:
Decked all in green, with sleeves of yellow silk
Slit to the elbow, slashed with various purples.
Her eyes were green as glass, her foot was leaf-like.
She was adorned with choicest emeralds,
And promised him the way of holy wisdom.
""Pretty green bank,"" began the half-lost poem.
Take the old way, say I met John Heydon,         
Sought out the place,
Lay on the bank, was ""plunged deep in swevyn;""
And saw the companyLayamon, Chaucer
Pass each in his appropriate robes;
Conversed with each, observed the varying fashion.
And then comes Heydon.
                                 ""I have seen John Heydon.""
Let us hear John Heydon!
                                 ""Omniformis
Omnis intellectus est""thus he begins, by spouting half of Psellus.
(Then comes a note, my assiduous commentator:
Not Psellus De Daemonibus, but Porphyry's Chances,
In the thirteenth chapter, that ""every intellect is omni-form."")
Magnifico Lorenzo used the dodge,
Says that he met Ficino
In some Wordsworthian, false-pastoral manner,
And that they walked along, stopped at a well-head,
And heard deep platitudes about contentment
From some old codger with an endless beard.
""A daemon is not a particular intellect,
But is a substance differed from intellect,""
Breaks in Ficino,
""Placed in the latitude or locus of souls""
That's out of Proclus, take your pick of them.
Valla, more earth and sounder rhetoric
Prefacing praise to his Pope Nicholas:
""A man of parts, skilled in the subtlest sciences;
A patron of the arts, of poetry; and of a fine discernment.""
Then comes a catalogue, his jewels of conversation.
No, you've not read your Elegantiae
A dull book?shook the church.
The prefaces, cut clear and hard:
""Know then the Roman speech, a sacrament,""
Spread for the nations, eucharist of wisdom,
Bread of the liberal arts.
                                 Ha! Sir Blancatz,
Sordello would have your heart to give to all the princes;
Valla, the heart of Rome,
Sustaining speech, set out before the people.
""Nec bonus Christianus ac bonus
                                 Tullianus.""
Marius, Du Bellay, wept for the buildings,
Baldassar Castiglione saw Raphael
""Lead back the soul into its dead, waste dwelling,""
Corpore laniato; and Lorenzo Valla,
""Broken in middle life? bent to submission?
Took a fat living from the Papacy""
(That's in Villari, but Burckhardt's statement is different)
""More than the Roman city, the Roman speech""
(Holds fast its part among the ever-living).
""Not by the eagles only was Rome measured.""
""Wherever the Roman speech was, there was Rome,""
Wherever the speech crept, there was mastery
Spoke with the law's voice while your Greek, logicians...
More Greeks than one! Doughty's ""divine Homeros""
Came before sophistry. Justinopolitan
Uncatalogued Andreas Divus,
Gave him in Latin, 1538 in my edition, the rest uncertain,
Caught up his cadence, word and syllable:
""Down to the ships we went, set mast and sail,
Black keel and beasts for bloody sacrifice,
Weeping we went.""
I've strained my ear for -ensa, -ombra, and -ensa
And cracked my wit on delicate canzoni
                   Here's but rough meaning:

""And then went down to the ship, set keel to breakers,
Forth on the godly sea;
We set up mast and sail on the swarthy ship,
Sheep bore we aboard her, and our bodies also
Heavy with weeping. And winds from sternward
Bore us out onward with bellying canvas
Circe's this craft, the trim-coifed goddess.
Then sat we amidships, wind jamming the tiller.
Thus with stretched sail
                   We went over sea till day's end:
Sun to his slumber, shadows o'er all the ocean.
Came we then to the bounds of deepest water,
To the Kimmerian lands and peopled cities
Covered with close-webbed mist, unpierced ever
With glitter of sun-rays,
Nor with stars stretched, nor looking back from heaven,
Swartest night stretched over wretched men there.
Thither we in that ship, unladed sheep there,
The ocean flowing backward, came we through to the place
Aforesaid by Circe.
Here did they rites, Perimedes and Eurylochus,
And drawing sword from my hip
I dug the ell-square pitkin, poured we libations unto each the dead,            
First mead and then sweet wine,
Water mixed with white flour.
Then prayed I many a prayer to the sickly death's-heads
As set in Ithaca, sterile bulls of the best,
For sacrifice, heaping the pyre with goods.
Sheep, to Tiresias only,
Black, and a bell sheep;
Dark blood flowed in the fosse.
Souls out of Erebus, cadaverous dead
Of brides, of youths, and of many passing old,
Virgins tender, souls stained with recent tears,
Many men mauled with bronze lance-heads,
Battle spoil, bearing yet dreary arms:
These many crowded about me,
With shouting, pallor upon me, cried to my men for more beasts;
Slaughtered the herdssheep slain of bronze,
Poured ointment, cried to the gods,
To Pluto the strong, and praised Proserpine.
Unsheathed the narrow steel,
I sat to keep off the impetuous, impotent dead
Till I should hear Tiresias.
But first Elpenor came, our friend Elpenor,
Unburied, cast on the wide earth
Limbs that we left in the house of Circe,
Unwept, unwrapped in sepulchre, since toils urged other,
Pitiful spiritand I cried in hurried speech:
'Elpenor, how art thou come to this dark coast?
Cam'st thou afoot, outstripping seamen?' And he in heavy speech:
'Ill fate and abundant wine! I slept in Circe's ingle,
Going down the long ladder unguarded, I fell against the buttress,
Shattered the nape-nerve, the soul sought Avernus.
But thou, O King, I bid remember me, unwept, unburied!
Heap up mine arms, be tomb by the sea-board, and inscribed,
A man of no fortune and with a name to come;
And set my oar up, that I swung 'mid fellows.'
Came then another ghost, whom I beat off, Anticlea,
And then Tiresias, Theban,
Holding his golden wand, knew me and spoke first:
'Man of ill hour, why come a second time,
Leaving the sunlight, facing the sunless dead and this joyless region?
Stand from the fosse, move back, leave me my bloody bever,
And I will speak you true speeches.'
                                                       ""And I stepped back,
Sheathing the yellow sword. Dark blood he drank then
And spoke: 'Lustrous Odysseus, shalt
Return through spiteful Neptune, over dark seas,
Lose all companions.' Foretold me the ways and the signs.
Came then Anticlea, to whom I answered:
'Fate drives me on through these deeps; I sought Tiresias.'
I told her news of Troy, and thrice her shadow
Faded in my embrace.
Then had I news of many faded women
Tyro, Alcmena, Chloris
Heard out their tales by that dark fosse, and sailed
By sirens and thence outward and away,
And unto Circe buried Elpenor's corpse.""

Lie quiet, Divus.

"My love looks like a girl to-night,
      But she is old.
The plaits that lie along her pillow
      Are not gold,
But threaded with filigree silver,
      And uncanny cold.

She looks like a young maiden, since her brow
      Is smooth and fair,
Her cheeks are very smooth, her eyes are closed.
      She sleeps a rare
Still winsome sleep, so still, and so composed.

Nay, but she sleeps like a bride, and dreams her dreams
      Of perfect things.
She lies at last, the darling, in the shape of her dream,
      And her dead mouth sings
By its shape, like the thrushes in clear evenings."
"I

The mind has shown itself at times
Too much the baked and labeled dough
Divided by accepted multitudes.
Across the stacked partitions of the day
Across the memoranda, baseball scores,
The stenographic smiles and stock quotations
Smutty wings flash out equivocations.

The mind is brushed by sparrow wings;
Numbers, rebuffed by asphalt, crowd
The margins of the day, accent the curbs,
Convoying divers dawns on every corner
To druggist, barber and tobacconist,
Until the graduate opacities of evening
Take them away as suddenly to somewhere
Virginal perhaps, less fragmentary, cool.

         There is the world dimensional for
       those untwisted by the love of things
       irreconcilable ...

And yet, suppose some evening I forgot
The fare and transfer, yet got by that way
Without recall,lost yet poised in traffic.
Then I might find your eyes across an aisle,
Still flickering with those prefigurations
Prodigal, yet uncontested now,
Half-riant before the jerky window frame.

There is some way, I think, to touch
Those hands of yours that count the nights
Stippled with pink and green advertisements.
And now, before its arteries turn dark
I would have you meet this bartered blood.
Imminent in his dream, none better knows
The white wafer cheek of love, or offers words
Lightly as moonlight on the eaves meets snow.

Reflective conversion of all things
At your deep blush, when ecstasies thread
The limbs and belly, when rainbows spread
Impinging on the throat and sides ...   
Inevitable, the body of the world
Weeps in inventive dust for the hiatus
That winks above it, bluet in your breasts.

The earth may glide diaphanous to death;
But if I lift my arms it is to bend
To you who turned away once, Helen, knowing
The press of troubled hands, too alternate
With steel and soil to hold you endlessly.
I meet you, therefore, in that eventual flame
You found in final chains, no captive then
Beyond their million brittle, bloodshot eyes;
White, through white cities passed on to assume
That world which comes to each of us alone.
Accept a lone eye riveted to your plane,
Bent axle of devotion along companion ways
That beat, continuous, to hourless days
One inconspicuous, glowing orb of praise.


       II

Brazen hypnotics glitter here;
Glee shifts from foot to foot,
Magnetic to their tremulo.
This crashing opera bouffe,
Blest excursion! this ricochet
From roof to roof
Know, Olympians, we are breathless
While nigger cupids scour the stars!

A thousand light shrugs balance us
Through snarling hails of melody.
White shadows slip across the floor
Splayed like cards from a loose hand;
Rhythmic ellipses lead into canters
Until somewhere a rooster banters.

Greet naivelyyet intrepidly
New soothings, new amazements
That cornets introduce at every turn
And you may fall downstairs with me
With perfect grace and equanimity.
Or, plaintively scud past shores
Where, by strange harmonic laws
All relatives, serene and cool,
Sit rocked in patent armchairs.

O,I have known metallic paradises
Where cuckoos clucked to finches
Above the deft catastrophes of drums.
While titters hailed the groans of death
Beneath gyrating awnings I have seen
The incunabula of the divine grotesque.
This music has a reassuring way.

The siren of the springs of guilty song
Let us take her on the incandescent wax
Striated with nuances, nervosities
That we are heir to: she is still so young,
We cannot frown upon her as she smiles,
Dipping here in this cultivated storm
Among slim skaters of the gardened skies.


       III

Capped arbiter of beauty in this street
That narrows darkly into motor dawn,
You, here beside me, delicate ambassador
Of intricate slain numbers that arise
In whispers, naked of steel;
                                       religious gunman!
Who faithfully, yourself, will fall too soon,
And in other ways than as the wind settles
On the sixteen thrifty bridges of the city:
Let us unbind our throats of fear and pity.

                                             We even,
Who drove speediest destruction
In corymbulous formations of mechanics,
Who hurried the hill breezes, spouting malice
Plangent over meadows, and looked down
On rifts of torn and empty houses
Like old women with teeth unjubilant
That waited faintly, briefly and in vain:

We know, eternal gunman, our flesh remembers
The tensile boughs, the nimble blue plateaus,
The mounted, yielding cities of the air!

That saddled sky that shook down vertical
Repeated play of fireno hypogeum
Of wave or rock was good against one hour.
We did not ask for that, but have survived,
And will persist to speak again before
All stubble streets that have not curved
To memory, or known the ominous lifted arm
That lowers down the arc of Helens brow
To saturate with blessing and dismay.

A goose, tobacco and cologne
Three winged and gold-shod prophecies of heaven,
The lavish heart shall always have to leaven
And spread with bells and voices, and atone
The abating shadows of our conscript dust.

Anchises navel, dripping of the sea,
The hands Erasmus dipped in gleaming tides,
Gathered the voltage of blown blood and vine;
Delve upward for the new and scattered wine,
O brother-thief of time, that we recall.
Laugh out the meager penance of their days
Who dare not share with us the breath released,
The substance drilled and spent beyond repair
For golden, or the shadow of gold hair.

Distinctly praise the years, whose volatile
Blamed bleeding hands extend and thresh the height
The imagination spans beyond despair,
Outpacing bargain, vocable and prayer."

"We passed old farmer Boothby in the field.
Rugged and straight he stood; his body steeled
With stubbornness and age. We met his eyes
That never flinched or turned to compromise,
And Luck, he cried, good luck!and waved an arm,
Knotted and sailor-like, such as no farm
In all of Maine could boast of; and away
He turned again to pitch his new-cut hay...
We walked on leisurely until a bend
Showed him once more, now working toward the end
Of one great path; wearing his eighty years
Like banners lifted in a wind of cheers.

Then we turned off abruptlytook the road
Cutting the village, the one with the commanding
View of the river. And we strode
More briskly now to the long pier that showed
Where the frail boats were kept at Indian Landing.
In the canoe we stepped; our paddles dipped
Leisurely downwards, and the slim bark slipped
More on than in the water. Smoothly then
We shot its nose against the rippling current,
Feeling the rising rivers half-deterrent
Pull on the paddle as we turned the blade
To keep from swerving round; while we delayed
To watch the curious wave-eaten locks;
Or pass, with lazy turns, the picnic-rocks....
Blue eels flew under us, and fishes darted
A thousand ways; the once broad channel shrunk.
And over us the wise and noble-hearted
Twilight leaned down; the sunset mists were parted,
And we, with thoughts on tiptoe, slunk
Down the green, twisting alleys of the Kennebunk,

Motionless in the meadows
The trees, the rocks, the cows...
And quiet dripped from the shadows
Like rain from heavy boughs.

The tree-toads started ringing
Their ceaseless silver bells;
A land-locked breeze came swinging
Its censer of earthy smells.

The rivers tiny canon
Stretched into dusky lands;
Like a dark and silent companion
Evening held out her hands.

Hushed were the dawns bravados;
Loud noon was a silenced cry
And quiet slipped from the shadows
As stars slip out of the sky...

It must have been an hour more, or later,
When, tramping homeward through the piney wood,
We felt the years fly back; the brotherhood
Of forests took usand we saw the satyr!
There in a pool, up to his neck, he stood
And grinned to see us stare, incredulous
Too startled to remember fear or flight.
Feeling the menace in the crafty night,
We turned to runwhen lo, he called to us!
Using our very names he called. We drew
With creaking courage down the avenue
Of birches till we saw, with clearing sight,
(No longer through a tricky, pale-green light)
Familiar turns and shrubs, the friendly path,
And Farmer Boothby in his woodland bath!
The woods became his background; every tree
Seemed part of him, and stood erect, and shared
The beauty of that gnarled serenity;
The quiet vigor of age that smiled and squared
Its shoulders against Time ... And even night
Flowed in and out of him, as though content
With such a native element;
Happy to move about a spirit quite
As old, as placid and as confident...
Sideways we turned. Still glistening and unclad
He leaped up on the bank, light as a lad,
His body in the moonlight dripping stars...

We went on homeward, through the pasture-bars."

"Living, I had no might
To make you hear,
Now, in the inmost night,
I am so near
No whisper, falling light,
Divides us, dear.

Living, I had no claim
On your great hours.
Now the thin candle-flame,
The closing flowers,
Wed summer with my name, 
And these are ours.

Your shadow on the dust,
Strength, and a cry,
Delight, despair, mistrust, 
All these am I.
Dawn, and the far hills thrust
To a far sky.

Living, I had no skill
To stay your tread,
Now all that was my will
Silence has said.
We are one for good and ill
Since I am dead."
"Momus is the name men give your face,
The brag of its tone, like a long low steamboat whistle
Finding a way mid mist on a shoreland,
Where gray rocks let the salt water shatter spray Against horizons purple, silent.

Yes, Momus,
Men have flung your face in bronze
To gaze in gargoyle downward on a street-whirl of folk.
They were artists did this, shaped your sad mouth,
Gave you a tall forehead slanted with calm, broad wisdom;
All your lips to the corners and your cheeks to the high bones
Thrown over and through with a smile that forever wishes and wishes, purple, silent, fled from all the iron things of life, evaded like a sought bandit, gone into dreams, by God.

I wonder, Momus,
Whether shadows of the dead sit somewhere and look with deep laughter
On men who play in terrible earnest the old, known, solemn repetitions of history.
A droning monotone soft as sea laughter hovers from your kindliness of bronze,
You give me the human ease of a mountain peak, purple, silent;
Granite shoulders heaving above the earth curves,
Careless eye-witness of the spawning tides of men and women
Swarming always in a drift of millions to the dust of toil, the salt of tears,
And blood drops of undiminishing war."
"Potuia, potuia
White grave goddess,
Pity my sadness,
O silence of Paros.

I am not of these about thy feet,
These garments and decorum;
I am thy brother,
Thy lover of aforetime crying to thee,
And thou hearest me not.

I have whispered thee in thy solitudes
Of our loves in Phrygia,
The far ecstasy of burning noons
When the fragile pipes
Ceased in the cypress shade,
And the brown fingers of the shepherd
Moved over slim shoulders;
And only the cicada sang.

I have told thee of the hills
And the lisp of reeds
And the sun upon thy breasts,

And thou hearest me not,
Potuia, potuia
Thou hearest me not."
"The ancient songs
Pass deathward mournfully.

Cold lips that sing no more, and withered wreaths,
Regretful eyes, and drooping breasts and wings
Symbols of ancient songs
Mournfully passing
Down to the great white surges,
Watched of none         - -
Save the frail sea-birds
And the lithe pale girls,
Daughters of Okeanos.

And the songs pass
From the green land
Which lies upon the waves as a leaf
On the flowers of hyacinth;
And they pass from the waters,
The manifold winds and the dim moon,
And they come,
Silently winging through soft Kimmerian dusk,
To the quiet level lands
That she keeps for us all,
That she wrought for us all for sleep
In the silver days of the earth's dawning
Proserpine, daughter of Zeus.

And we turn from the Kuprian's breasts,
And we turn from thee,
Phoibos Apollon,
And we turn from the music of old
And the hills that we loved and the meads,
And we turn from the fiery day,
And the lips that were over-sweet;
For silently
Brushing the fields with red-shod feet,
With purple robe
Searing the flowers as with a sudden flame,
Death,
Thou hast come upon us.

And of all the ancient songs
Passing to the swallow-blue halls
By the dark streams of Persephone,
This only remains:
That in the end we turn to thee,
Death,
That we turn to thee, singing
One last song.

O Death,
Thou art an healing wind
That blowest over white flowers
A-tremble with dew;
Thou art a wind flowing
Over long leagues of lonely sea;
Thou art the dusk and the fragrance;
Thou art the lips of love mournfully smiling;
Thou art the pale peace of one
Satiate with old desires;
Thou art the silence of beauty,
And we look no more for the morning;
We yearn no more for the sun,
Since with thy white hands,
Death,
Thou crownest us with the pallid chaplets,
The slim colorless poppies
Which in thy garden alone
Softly thou gatherest.

And silently;
And with slow feet approaching;
And with bowed head and unlit eyes,
We kneel before thee:
And thou, leaning towards us, Caressingly layest upon us
Flowers from thy thin cold hands,
And, smiling as a chaste woman Knowing love in her heart,
Thou sealest our eyes
And the illimitable quietude
Comes gently upon us."
"Knock knock He has closed his door
The gardens lilies have started to rot
So who is the corpse being carried from the house

You just knocked on his door

And trot trot

Trot goes little lady mouse

Translated from the French "
"I have built a house in the middle of the Ocean
Its windows are the rivers flowing from my eyes
Octopi are crawling all over where the walls are
Hear their triple hearts beat and their beaks peck against the windowpanes

House of dampness
House of burning
Seasons fastness
Season singing
The airplanes are laying eggs
Watch out for the dropping of the anchor

Watch out for the shooting black ichor
It would be good if you were to come from the sky
The skys honeysuckle is climbing
The earthly octopi are throbbing
And so very many of us have become our own gravediggers
Pale octopi of the chalky waves O octopi with pale beaks
Around the house is this ocean that you know well
  And is never still

"O sweet everlasting Voices, be still;
Go to the guards of the heavenly fold
And bid them wander obeying your will,
Flame under flame, till Time be no more;
Have you not heard that our hearts are old,
That you call in birds, in wind on the hill,
In shaken boughs, in tide on the shore?
O sweet everlasting Voices, be still."
"Although you hide in the ebb and flow
Of the pale tide when the moon has set,
The people of coming days will know
About the casting out of my net,
And how you have leaped times out of mind
Over the little silver cords,
And think that you were hard and unkind,
And blame you with many bitter words."
"She that but little patience knew,
From childhood on, had now so much
A grey gull lost its fear and flew
Down to her cell and there alit,
And there endured her fingers' touch
And from her fingers ate its bit.

Did she in touching that lone wing
Recall the years before her mind
Became a bitter, an abstract thing,
Her thought some popular enmity:
Blind and leader of the blind
Drinking the foul ditch where they lie?

When long ago I saw her ride
Under Ben Bulben to the meet,
The beauty of her country-side
With all youth's lonely wildness stirred,
She seemed to have grown clean and sweet
Like any rock-bred, sea-borne bird:

Sea-borne, or balanced in the air
When first it sprang out of the nest
Upon some lofty rock to stare
Upon the cloudy canopy,
While under its storm-beaten breast
Cried out the hollows of the sea."
"There was a man whom Sorrow named his friend,
And he, of his high comrade Sorrow dreaming,
Went walking with slow steps along the gleaming
And humming sands, where windy surges wend:
And he called loudly to the stars to bend
From their pale thrones and comfort him, but they
Among themselves laugh on and sing alway:
And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend
Cried out, Dim sea, hear my most piteous story!
The sea swept on and cried her old cry still,
Rolling along in dreams from hill to hill.
He fled the persecution of her glory
And, in a far-off, gentle valley stopping,
Cried all his story to the dewdrops glistening.
But naught they heard, for they are always listening,
The dewdrops, for the sound of their own dropping.
And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend
Sought once again the shore, and found a shell,
And thought, I will my heavy story tell
Till my own words, re-echoing, shall send
Their sadness through a hollow, pearly heart;
And my own tale again for me shall sing,
And my own whispering words be comforting,
And lo! my ancient burden may depart.
Then he sang softly nigh the pearly rim;
But the sad dweller by the sea-ways lone
Changed all he sang to inarticulate moan
Among her wildering whirls, forgetting him."
"The woods of Arcady are dead,
And over is their antique joy;
Of old the world on dreaming fed;
Grey Truth is now her painted toy;
Yet still she turns her restless head:
But O, sick children of the world,
Of all the many changing things
In dreary dancing past us whirled,
To the cracked tune that Chronos sings,
Words alone are certain good.
Where are now the warring kings,
Word be-mockers?  By the Rood
Where are now the warring kings?
An idle word is now their glory,
By the stammering schoolboy said,
Reading some entangled story:
The kings of the old time are dead;
The wandering earth herself may be
Only a sudden flaming word,
In clanging space a moment heard,
Troubling the endless reverie.

Then nowise worship dusty deeds,
Nor seek, for this is also sooth,
To hunger fiercely after truth,
Lest all thy toiling only breeds
New dreams, new dreams; there is no truth
Saving in thine own heart. Seek, then,
No learning from the starry men,
Who follow with the optic glass
The whirling ways of stars that pass  
Seek, then, for this is also sooth,
No word of theirs  the cold star-bane
Has cloven and rent their hearts in twain,
And dead is all their human truth.
Go gather by the humming sea
Some twisted, echo-harbouring shell,
And to its lips thy story tell,
And they thy comforters will be,
Rewarding in melodious guile
Thy fretful words a little while,
Till they shall singing fade in ruth
And die a pearly brotherhood;
For words alone are certain good:
Sing, then, for this is also sooth.

I must be gone: there is a grave
Where daffodil and lily wave,
And I would please the hapless faun,
Buried under the sleepy ground,
With mirthful songs before the dawn.
His shouting days with mirth were crowned;
And still I dream he treads the lawn,
Walking ghostly in the dew,
Pierced by my glad singing through,
My songs of old earth's dreamy youth:
But ah! she dreams not now; dream thou!
For fair are poppies on the brow:
Dream, dream, for this is also sooth."

"Only the wanderer
   Knows England's graces,
Or can anew see clear
   Familiar faces.

And who loves joy as he
   That dwells in shadows?
Do not forget me quite,
   O Severn meadows."
"He's gone, and all our plans
   Are useless indeed.
We'll walk no more on Cotswold
   Where the sheep feed
   Quietly and take no heed.
 
His body that was so quick
   Is not as you
Knew it, on Severn river
   Under the blue
   Driving our small boat through.
 
You would not know him now ...
   But still he died
Nobly, so cover him over
   With violets of pride
   Purple from Severn side.
 
Cover him, cover him soon!
   And with thick-set
Masses of memoried flowers
   Hide that red wet
   Thing I must somehow forget."
"By a peninsula the painter sat and
Sketched the uneven valley groves.
The apostle gave alms to the
Meek. The volcano burst
In fusive sulphur and hurled
Rocks and ore into the air
Heavens sudden change at
The drawing tempestuous,
Darkening shade of dense clouded hues.
The wanderer soon chose
His spot of rest; they bore the
Chosen hero upon their shoulders,
Whom they strangely admired, as
The beach-tide summer of people desired."
"Is this the river East I heard?
Where the ferries, tugs and sailboats stirred
And the reaching wharves from the inner land
Ourstretched, like the harmless receiving hand
 
And the silvery tinge that sparkles aloud
Like the brilliant white demons, which a tide has towed
From the rays of the morning sun
Which it doth ceaselessly shine upon.
 
But look at the depth of the drippling tide
The dripples, reripples like the locusts astride;
As the boat turns upon the silvery spread
It leavesstrangea shadow dead.
 
And the very charms from the reflective river
And from the stacks of the floating boat
There seemeth the quality neer to dissever
Like the ruffles from the mystified smoke."
"The motion of gathering loops of water
Must either burst or remain in a moment.
The violet colors through the glass
Throw up little swellings that appear
And spatter as soon as another strikes
And is born; so pure are they of colored
Hues, that we feel the absent strength
Of its power. When they begin they gather
Like sand on the beach: each bubble
Contains a complete eye of water."
"I went out to the hazel wood,
Because a fire was in my head,
And cut and peeled a hazel wand,
And hooked a berry to a thread;
And when white moths were on the wing,
And moth-like stars were flickering out,
I dropped the berry in a stream
And caught a little silver trout.

When I had laid it on the floor
I went to blow the fire a-flame,
But something rustled on the floor,
And someone called me by my name:
It had become a glimmering girl
With apple blossom in her hair
Who called me by my name and ran
And faded through the brightening air.

Though I am old with wandering
Through hollow lands and hilly lands,
I will find out where she has gone,
And kiss her lips and take her hands;
And walk among long dappled grass,
And pluck till time and times are done,
The silver apples of the moon,
The golden apples of the sun."

"Barque of phosphor
On the palmy beach,
 
Move outward into heaven,
Into the alabasters
And night blues.
 
Foam and cloud are one.
Sultry moon-monsters
Are dissolving.
 
Fill your black hull
With white moonlight.
 
There will never be an end
To this droning of the surf."
"The trade-wind jingles the rings in the nets around the racks by the docks on Indian River.
It is the same jingle of the water among roots under the banks of the palmettoes,
It is the same jingle of the red-bird breasting the orange-treesout of the cedars.
Yet there is no spring in Florida, neither in boskage perdu, nor on the nunnery beaches."
"Her terrace was the sand
And the palms and the twilight.
 
She made of the motions of her wrist
The grandiose gestures
Of her thought.
 
The rumpling of the plumes
Of this creature of the evening
Came to be sleights of sails
Over the sea.
 
And thus she roamed
In the roamings of her fan,

Partaking of the sea,
And of the evening,
As they flowed around
And uttered their subsiding sound."
"As the immense dew of Florida
Brings forth
The big-finned palm
And green vine angering for life,
 
As the immense dew of Florida
Brings forth hymn and hymn
From the beholder,
Beholding all these green sides
And gold sides of green sides,
 
And blessed mornings,
Meet for the eye of the young alligator,
And lightning colors
So, in me, come flinging
Forms, flames, and the flakes of flames."
from Coterie, 1919

"The moon has left the sky, love,
The stars are hiding now,
And frowning on the world, love,
Night bares her sable brow.

The snow is on the ground, love,
And cold and keen the air is.
Im singing here to you, love;
Youre dreaming there in Paris.

But this is Natures law, love,
Though just it may not seem,
That men should wake to sing, love;
While maidens sleep and dream.

Them care may not molest, love,
Nor stir them from their slumbers,
Though midnight find the swain, love.
Still halting oer his numbers.

I watch the rosy dawn, love,
Come stealing up the east,
While all things round rejoice, love,
That Night her reign has ceased.

The lark will soon be heard, love,
And on his way be winging;
When Natures poets, wake, love,
Why should a man be singing?"
"The buffaloes are gone.
And those who saw the buffaloes are gone.
Those who saw the buffaloes by thousands and how they pawed the prairie sod into dust with their hoofs, their great heads down pawing on in a great pageant of dusk,
Those who saw the buffaloes are gone.
And the buffaloes are gone."
"There is a wolf in me . . . fangs pointed for tearing gashes . . . a red tongue for raw meat . . . and the hot lapping of bloodI keep this wolf because the wilderness gave it to me and the wilderness will not let it go.    

There is a fox in me . . . a silver-gray fox . . . I sniff and guess . . . I pick things out of the wind and air . . . I nose in the dark night and take sleepers and eat them and hide the feathers . . . I circle and loop and double-cross.

There is a hog in me . . . a snout and a belly . . . a machinery for eating and grunting . . . a machinery for sleeping satisfied in the sunI got this too from the wilderness and the wilderness will not let it go.

There is a fish in me . . . I know I came from salt-blue water-gates . . . I scurried with shoals of herring . . . I blew waterspouts with porpoises . . . before land was . . . before the water went down . . . before Noah . . . before the first chapter of Genesis.

There is a baboon in me . . . clambering-clawed . . . dog-faced . . . yawping a galoots hunger . . . hairy under the armpits . . . here are the hawk-eyed hankering men . . . here are the blonde and blue-eyed women . . . here they hide curled asleep waiting . . . ready to snarl and kill . . . ready to sing and give milk . . . waitingI keep the baboon because the wilderness says so.

There is an eagle in me and a mockingbird . . . and the eagle flies among the Rocky Mountains of my dreams and fights among the Sierra crags of what I want . . . and the mockingbird warbles in the early forenoon before the dew is gone, warbles in the underbrush of my Chattanoogas of hope, gushes over the blue Ozark foothills of my wishesAnd I got the eagle and the mockingbird from the wilderness.

O, I got a zoo, I got a menagerie, inside my ribs, under my bony head, under my red-valve heartand I got something else: it is a man-child heart, a woman-child heart: it is a father and mother and lover: it came from God-Knows-Where: it is going to God-Knows-WhereFor I am the keeper of the zoo: I say yes and no: I sing and kill and work: I am a pal of the world: I came from the wilderness."
"The sea-wash never ends.
The sea-wash repeats, repeats.
Only old songs? Is that all the sea knows?
             Only the old strong songs?
             Is that all?
The sea-wash repeats, repeats."
"I went out at night alone;
 The young blood flowing beyond the sea
Seemed to have drenched my spirits wings
 I bore my sorrow heavily.

But when I lifted up my head
 From shadows shaken on the snow,
I saw Orion in the east
 Burn steadily as long ago.

From windows in my fathers house,
 Dreaming my dreams on winter nights,
I watched Orion as a girl
 Above another citys lights.

Years go, dreams go, and youth goes too,
 The worlds heart breaks beneath its wars,
All things are changed, save in the east
 The faithful beauty of the stars."

"Openly, yes,
         With the naturalness
         Of the hippopotamus or the alligator
When it climbs out on the bank to experience the

Sun, I do these
Things which I do, which please
         No one but myself.  Now I breathe and now I am sub-
         Merged; the blemishes stand up and shout when the object

In view was a
Renaissance; shall I say
         The contrary?  The sediment of the river which
         Encrusts my joints, makes me very gray but I am used

To it, it may
Remain there; do away
         With it and I am myself done away with, for the
         Patina of circumstance can but enrich what was

There to begin
With.  This elephant skin
         Which I inhabit, fibered over like the shell of
         The coco-nut, this piece of black glass through which no light

Can filtercut
Into checkers by rut
         Upon rut of unpreventable experience
         It is a manual for the peanut-tongued and the

Hairy toed.  Black
But beautiful, my back
         Is full of the history of power.  Of power?  What
         Is powerful and what is not?  My soul shall never

Be cut into
By a wooden spear; through-
         Out childhood to the present time, the unity of
         Life and death has been expressed by the circumference

Described by my
Trunk; nevertheless, I
         Perceive feats of strength to be inexplicable after
         All; and I am on my guard; external poise, it

Has its centre
Well nurturedwe know
         Wherein pride, but spiritual poise, it has its centre where ?
         My ears are sensitized to more than the sound of

The wind.  I see
And I hear, unlike the
         Wandlike body of which one hears so much, which was made
         To see and not to see; to hear and not to hear,

That tree trunk without   
Roots, accustomed to shout
         Its own thoughts to itself like a shell, maintained intact   
         By who knows what strange pressure of the  atmosphere; that   

Spiritual   
Brother to the coral
         Plant, absorbed into which, the equable sapphire light
         Becomes a nebulous green.  The I of each is to

The I of each,
A kind of fretful speech
         Which sets a limit on itself; the elephant is?
         Black earth preceded by a tendril?  It is to that

Phenomenon
The above formation,   
         Translucent like the atmospherea cortex merely
         That on which darts cannot strike decisively the first

Time, a substance
Needful as an instance
         Of the indestructibility of matter; it   
         Has looked at the electricity and at the earth-

Quake and is still
Here; the name means thick.  Will
         Depth be depth, thick skin be thick, to one who can see no
         Beautiful element of unreason under it?"
"Man, looking into the sea
taking the view from those who have as much right to it as you have it to yourself
it is human nature to stand in the middle of a thing
but you cannot stand in the middle of this:
the sea has nothing to give but a well excavated grave.
The firs stand in a processioneach with an emerald turkey-foot at the top
reserved as their contours, saying nothing;
repression, however, is not the most obvious characteristic of the sea;
the sea is a collector, quick to return a rapacious look.
There are others besides you who have worn that look
whose expression is no longer a protest; the fish no longer investigate them
for their bones have not lasted;
men lower nets, unconscious of the fact that they are desecrating a grave,
and row quickly awaythe blades of the oars   
moving together like the feet of water-spiders as if there were no such thing as death.
The wrinkles progress upon themselves in a phalanxbeautiful under networks of foam,
and fade breathlessly while the sea rustles in and out of the seaweed;
the birds swim through the air at top speed, emitting cat-calls as heretofore
the tortoise-shell scourges about the feet of the cliffs, in motion beneath them
and the ocean, under the pulsation of light-houses and noise of bell-buoys,
advances as usual, looking as if it were not that ocean in which dropped things are bound to sink
in which if they turn and twist, it is neither with volition nor consciousness."
"My bands of silk and miniver
Momently grew heavier;
The black gauze was beggarly thin;
The ermine muffled mouth and chin;
I could not suck the moonlight in.

Harlequin in lozenges
Of love and hate, I walked in these
Striped and ragged rigmaroles;
Along the pavement my footsoles
Trod warily on living coals.

Shouldering the thoughts I loathed,
In their corrupt disguises clothed,
Morality I could not tear
From my ribs, to leave them bare
Ivory in silver air.

There I walked, and there I raged;
The spiritual savage caged
Within my skeleton, raged afresh
To feel, behind a carnal mesh,
The clean bones crying in the flesh."
"                                  1 

When the world turns completely upside down
You say well emigrate to the Eastern Shore
Aboard a river-boat from Baltimore;
Well live among wild peach trees, miles from town,
Youll wear a coonskin cap, and I a gown
Homespun, dyed butternuts dark gold color.
Lost, like your lotus-eating ancestor,
Well swim in milk and honey till we drown.

The winter will be short, the summer long,
The autumn amber-hued, sunny and hot,
Tasting of cider and of scuppernong;
All seasons sweet, but autumn best of all.
The squirrels in their silver fur will fall
Like falling leaves, like fruit, before your shot.


                                  2 

The autumn frosts will lie upon the grass
Like bloom on grapes of purple-brown and gold.
The misted early mornings will be cold;
The little puddles will be roofed with glass.
The sun, which burns from copper into brass,
Melts these at noon, and makes the boys unfold
Their knitted mufflers; full as they can hold
Fat pockets dribble chestnuts as they pass.

Peaches grow wild, and pigs can live in clover;
A barrel of salted herrings lasts a year;
The spring begins before the winters over.
By February you may find the skins
Of garter snakes and water moccasins
Dwindled and harsh, dead-white and cloudy-clear.


                                  3 

When April pours the colors of a shell
Upon the hills, when every little creek
Is shot with silver from the Chesapeake
In shoals new-minted by the ocean swell,
When strawberries go begging, and the sleek
Blue plums lie open to the blackbirds beak,
We shall live well  we shall live very well.

The months between the cherries and the peaches
Are brimming cornucopias which spill
Fruits red and purple, sombre-bloomed and black;
Then, down rich fields and frosty river beaches
Well trample bright persimmons, while you kill
Bronze partridge, speckled quail, and canvasback.


                                  4 

Down to the Puritan marrow of my bones
Theres something in this richness that I hate.
I love the look, austere, immaculate,
Of landscapes drawn in pearly monotones.
Theres something in my very blood that owns
Bare hills, cold silver on a sky of slate,
A thread of water, churned to milky spate
Streaming through slanted pastures fenced with stones.

I love those skies, thin blue or snowy gray,
Those fields sparse-planted, rendering meagre sheaves;
That spring, briefer than apple-blossoms breath,
Summer, so much too beautiful to stay,
Swift autumn, like a bonfire of leaves,
And sleepy winter, like the sleep of death."

"Perspective never withers from their eyes;   
They keep that docile edict of the Spring
That blends March with August Antarctic skies:   
These are but cows that see no other thing   
Than grass and snow, and their own inner being   
Through the rich halo that they do not trouble   
Even to cast upon the seasons fleeting
Though they should thin and die on last years stubble.

And they are awkward, ponderous and uncoy . . .   
While we who press the cider mill, regarding them
We, who with pledges taste the bright annoy   
Of friendships acid wine, retarding phlegm,
Shifting reprisals (til who shall tell us when
The jest is too sharp to be kindly?) boast
Much of our store of faith in other men
Who would, ourselves, stalk down the merriest ghost.

Above them old Mizzentop, palatial white   
Hostelryfloor by floor to cinquefoil dormer   
Portholes the ceilings stack their stoic height.   
Long tiers of windows staring out toward former   
Facesloose panes crown the hill and gleam   
At sunset with a silent, cobwebbed patience . . .   

See them, like eyes that still uphold some dream   
Through mapled vistas, cancelled reservations!

High from the central cupola, they say
Ones glance could cross the borders of three states;   
But I have seen deaths stare in slow survey   
From four horizons that no one relates . . .   
Weekenders avid of their turf-won scores,
Here three hours from the semaphores, the Czars
Of golf, by twos and threes in plaid plusfours   
Alight with sticks abristle and cigars.

This was the Promised Land, and still it is
To the persuasive suburban land agent
In bootleg roadhouses where the gin fizz
Bubbles in time to Hollywoods new love-nest pageant.   
Fresh from the radio in the old Meeting House   
(Now the New Avalon Hotel) volcanoes roar
A welcome to highsteppers that no mouse
Who saw the Friends there ever heard before.

What cunning neighbors history has in fine!   
The woodlouse mortgages the ancient deal   
Table that Powitzky buys for only nine-   
Ty-five at Adams auction,eats the seal,   
The spinster polish of antiquity . . .   
Who holds the lease on time and on disgrace?   
What eats the pattern with ubiquity?
Where are my kinsmen and the patriarch race?

The resigned factions of the dead preside.   
Dead rangers bled their comfort on the snow;   
But I must ask slain Iroquois to guide
Me farther than scalped Yankees knew to go:   
Shoulder the curse of sundered parentage,   
Wait for the postman driving from Birch Hill   
With birthright by blackmail, the arrant page   
That unfolds a new destiny to fill . . . .   

So, must we from the hawks far stemming view,   
Must we descend as worms eye to construe   
Our love of all we touch, and take it to the Gate
As humbly as a guest who knows himself too late,
His news already told? Yes, while the heart is wrung,
Ariseyes, take this sheaf of dust upon your tongue!
In one last angelus lift throbbing throat
Listen, transmuting silence with that stilly note

Of pain that Emily, that Isadora knew!
While high from dim elm-chancels hung with dew,
That triple-noted clause of moonlight
Yes, whip-poor-will, unhusks the heart of fright,
Breaks us and saves, yes, breaks the heart, yet yields
That patience that is armour and that shields
Love from despairwhen love forsees the end
Leaf after autumnal leaf
                                    break off,
                                                   descend
                                                               descend"
"I wanted you, nameless Woman of the South,
No wraith, but utterlyas still more alone
The Southern Cross takes night
And lifts her girdles from her, one by one
High, cool,
wide from the slowly smoldering fire
Of lower heavens,
vaporous scars!

Eve! Magdalene!
or Mary, you?

Whatever callfalls vainly on the wave.
O simian Venus, homeless Eve,
Unwedded, stumbling gardenless to grieve
Windswept guitars on lonely decks forever;
Finally to answer all within one grave!

And this long wake of phosphor,
iridescent
Furrow of all our traveltrailed derision!
Eyes crumble at its kiss. Its long-drawn spell
Incites a yell. Slid on that backward vision
The mind is churned to spittle, whispering hell.

I wanted you . . . The embers of the Cross
Climbed by aslant and huddling aromatically.
It is blood to remember; it is fire
To stammer back . . . It is
Godyour namelessness. And the wash

All night the water combed you with black
Insolence. You crept out simmering, accomplished.
Water rattled that stinging coil, your
Rehearsed hairdocile, alas, from many arms.
Yes, Evewraith of my unloved seed!

The Cross, a phantom, buckleddropped below the dawn.
Light drowned the lithic trillions of your spawn."

"The low sandy beach and the thin scrub pine,
The wide reach of bay and the long sky line,
O, I am sick for home!

The salt, salt smell of the thick sea air,
And the smooth round stones that the ebbtides wear,
When will the good ship come?

The wretched stumps all charred and burned,
And the deep soft rut where the cartwheel turned,
Why is the world so old?

The lapping wave, and the broad gray sky
Where the cawing crows and the slow gulls fly,
Where are the dead untold?

The thin, slant willows by the flooded bog,
The huge stranded hulk and the floating log,
Sorrow with life began!

And among the dark pines, and along the flat shore,
O the wind, and the wind, for evermore!
What will become of man?"

"While my hair was still cut straight across my forehead
I played about the front gate, pulling flowers.
You came by on bamboo stilts, playing horse,
You walked about my seat, playing with blue plums.
And we went on living in the village of Chokan:
Two small people, without dislike or suspicion.
At fourteen I married My Lord you.
I never laughed, being bashful.
Lowering my head, I looked at the wall.
Called to, a thousand times, I never looked back.

At fifteen I stopped scowling,
I desired my dust to be mingled with yours
Forever and forever, and forever.
Why should I climb the look out?

At sixteen you departed
You went into far Ku-to-en, by the river of swirling eddies,
And you have been gone five months.
The monkeys make sorrowful noise overhead.

You dragged your feet when you went out.
By the gate now, the moss is grown, the different mosses,
Too deep to clear them away!
The leaves fall early this autumn, in wind.
The paired butterflies are already yellow with August
Over the grass in the West garden;
They hurt me.
I grow older.
If you are coming down through the narrows of the river Kiang,
Please let me know beforehand,
And I will come out to meet you
As far as Cho-fu-Sa."
Originally published in Poetry, March 1914.
"Since there is no escape, since at the end
My body will be utterly destroyed,
This hand I love as I have loved a friend,
This body I tended, wept with and enjoyed;
Since there is no escape even for me
Who love life with a love too sharp to bear:
The scent of orchards in the rain, the sea
And hours alone too still and sure for prayer
Since darkness waits for me, then all the more
Let me go down as waves sweep to the shore
In pride, and let me sing with my last breath;
In these few hours of light I lift my head;
Life is my loverI shall leave the dead
If there is any way to baffle death."

"I know what the caged bird feels, alas!
    When the sun is bright on the upland slopes;   
When the wind stirs soft through the springing grass,   
And the river flows like a stream of glass;
    When the first bird sings and the first bud opes,   
And the faint perfume from its chalice steals
I know what the caged bird feels!

I know why the caged bird beats his wing
    Till its blood is red on the cruel bars;   
For he must fly back to his perch and cling   
When he fain would be on the bough a-swing;
    And a pain still throbs in the old, old scars   
And they pulse again with a keener sting
I know why he beats his wing!

I know why the caged bird sings, ah me,
    When his wing is bruised and his bosom sore,
When he beats his bars and he would be free;
It is not a carol of joy or glee,
    But a prayer that he sends from his hearts deep core,   
But a plea, that upward to Heaven he flings
I know why the caged bird sings!"

"There may be chaos still around the world,
This little world that in my thinking lies;
For mine own bosom is the paradise
Where all my lifes fair visions are unfurled.
Within my natures shell I slumber curled,
Unmindful of the changing outer skies,
Where now, perchance, some new-born Eros flies,
Or some old Cronos from his throne is hurled.
I heed them not; or if the subtle night
Haunt me with deities I never saw,
I soon mine eyelids drowsy curtain draw
To hide their myriad faces from my sight.
They threat in vain; the whirlwind cannot awe
A happy snow-flake dancing in the flaw."
"I
Among twenty snowy mountains,   
The only moving thing   
Was the eye of the blackbird.   

II
I was of three minds,   
Like a tree   
In which there are three blackbirds.   

III
The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds.   
It was a small part of the pantomime.   

IV
A man and a woman   
Are one.   
A man and a woman and a blackbird   
Are one.   

V
I do not know which to prefer,   
The beauty of inflections   
Or the beauty of innuendoes,   
The blackbird whistling   
Or just after.   

VI
Icicles filled the long window   
With barbaric glass.   
The shadow of the blackbird   
Crossed it, to and fro.   
The mood   
Traced in the shadow   
An indecipherable cause.   

VII
O thin men of Haddam,   
Why do you imagine golden birds?   
Do you not see how the blackbird   
Walks around the feet   
Of the women about you?   

VIII
I know noble accents   
And lucid, inescapable rhythms;   
But I know, too,   
That the blackbird is involved   
In what I know.   

IX
When the blackbird flew out of sight,   
It marked the edge   
Of one of many circles.   

X
At the sight of blackbirds   
Flying in a green light,   
Even the bawds of euphony   
Would cry out sharply.   

XI
He rode over Connecticut   
In a glass coach.   
Once, a fear pierced him,   
In that he mistook   
The shadow of his equipage   
For blackbirds.   

XII
The river is moving.   
The blackbird must be flying.   

XIII
It was evening all afternoon.   
It was snowing   
And it was going to snow.   
The blackbird sat   
In the cedar-limbs."
"I

Calm was the sea to which your course you kept,
Oh, how much calmer than all southern seas!
Many your nameless mates, whom the keen breeze
Wafted from mothers that of old have wept.
All souls of children taken as they slept
Are your companions, partners of your ease,
And the green souls of all these autumn trees
Are with you through the silent spaces swept.
Your virgin body gave its gentle breath
Untainted to the gods. Why should we grieve,
But that we merit not your holy death?
We shall not loiter long, your friends and I;
Living you made it goodlier to live,
Dead you will make it easier to die.

II

With you a part of me hath passed away;
For in the peopled forest of my mind
A tree made leafless by this wintry wind
Shall never don again its green array.
Chapel and fireside, country road and bay,
Have something of their friendliness resigned;
Another, if I would, I could not find,
And I am grown much older in a day.
But yet I treasure in my memory
Your gift of charity, your mellow ease,
And the dear honour of your amity;
For these once mine, my life is rich with these.
And I scarce know which part may greater be,
What I keep of you, or you rob of me.

III

Your bark lies anchored in the peaceful bight
Until a kinder wind unfurl her sail;
Your docile spirit, winged by this gale,
Hath at the dawning fled into the light.
And I half know why heaven deemed it right
Your youth, and this my joy in youth, should fail;
God hath them still, for ever they avail,
Eternity hath borrowed that delight.
For long ago I taught my thoughts to run
Where all the great things live that lived of yore,
And in eternal quiet float and soar;
There all my loves are gathered into one,
Where change is not, nor parting any more,
Nor revolution of the moon and sun.

IV

In my deep heart these chimes would still have rung
To toll your passing, had you not been dead;
For time a sadder mask than death may spread
Over the face that ever should be young.
The bough that falls with all its trophies hung
Falls not too soon, but lays its flower-crowned head
Most royal in the dust, with no leaf shed
Unhallowed or unchiselled or unsung.
And though the after world will never hear
The happy name of one so gently true,
Nor chronicles write large this fatal year,
Yet we who loved you, though we be but few,
Keep you in whatsoeer is good, and rear
In our weak virtues monuments to you."

"But then there comes that moment rare
When, for no cause that I can find,
The little voices of the air
Sound above all the sea and wind.

The sea and wind do then obey
And sighing, sighing double notes
Of double basses, content to play
A droning chord for the little throats

The little throats that sing and rise
Up into the light with lovely ease
And a kind of magical, sweet surprise
To hear and know themselves for these

For these little voices: the bee, the fly,
The leaf that taps, the pod that breaks,
The breeze on the grass-tops bending by,
The shrill quick sound that the insect makes."

"Even iron can put forth,
Even iron.

This is the iron age,
But let us take heart
Seeing iron break and bud,
Seeing rusty iron puff with clouds of blossom.

The almond-tree,
December's bare iron hooks sticking out of earth.

The almond-tree,
That knows the deadliest poison, like a snake
In supreme bitterness.

Upon the iron, and upon the steel,
Odd flakes as if of snow, odd bits of snow,
Odd crumbs of melting snow.

But you mistake, it is not from the sky;
From out the iron, and from out the steel,
Flying not down from heaven, but storming up,
Strange storming up from the dense under-earth
Along the iron, to the living steel
In rose-hot tips, and flakes of rose-pale snow
Setting supreme annunciation to the world.

Nay, what a heart of delicate super-faith,
Iron-breaking,
The rusty swords of almond-trees.

Trees suffer, like races, down the long ages.
They wander and are exiled, they live in exile through long ages
Like drawn blades never sheathed, hacked and gone black,
The alien trees in alien lands: and yet
The heart of blossom,
The unquenchable heart of blossom!

Look at the many-cicatrised frail vine, none more scarred and frail,
Yet see him fling himself abroad in fresh abandon
From the small wound-stump.

Even the wilful, obstinate, gummy fig-tree
Can be kept down, but he'll burst like a polyp into prolixity.

And the almond-tree, in exile, in the iron age!

This is the ancient southern earth whence the vases were baked, amphoras, craters, cantharus, oenochoe, and open-hearted cylix,
Bristling now with the iron of almond-trees

Iron, but unforgotten,
Iron, dawn-hearted,
Ever-beating dawn-heart, enveloped in iron against the exile, against the ages.

See it come forth in blossom
From the snow-remembering heart
In long-nighted January,
In the long dark nights of the evening star, and Sirius, and the Etna snow-wind through the long night.

Sweating his drops of blood through the long-nighted Gethsemane
Into blossom, into pride, into honey-triumph, into most exquisite splendour.
Oh, give me the tree of life in blossom
And the Cross sprouting its superb and fearless flowers!

Something must be reassuring to the almond, in the evening star, and the snow-wind, and the long, long, nights,
Some memory of far, sun-gentler lands,
So that the faith in his heart smiles again
And his blood ripples with that untenable delight of once-more-vindicated faith,
And the Gethsemane blood at the iron pores unfolds, unfolds,
Pearls itself into tenderness of bud
And in a great and sacred forthcoming steps forth, steps out in one stride
A naked tree of blossom, like a bridegroom bathing in dew, divested of cover,
Frail-naked, utterly uncovered
To the green night-baying of the dog-star, Etna's snow-edged wind
And January's loud-seeming sun.

Think of it, from the iron fastness
Suddenly to dare to come out naked, in perfection of blossom, beyond the sword-rust.
Think, to stand there in full-unfolded nudity, smiling,
With all the snow-wind, and the sun-glare, and the dog-star baying epithalamion.

Oh, honey-bodied beautiful one,
Come forth from iron,
Red your heart is.
Fragile-tender, fragile-tender life-body,
More fearless than iron all the time,
And so much prouder, so disdainful of reluctances.

In the distance like hoar-frost, like silvery ghosts communing on a green hill,
Hoar-frost-like and mysterious.

In the garden raying out
With a body like spray, dawn-tender, and looking about
With such insuperable, subtly-smiling assurance,
Sword-blade-born.

Unpromised,
No bounds being set.
Flaked out and come unpromised,
The tree being life-divine,
Fearing nothing, life-blissful at the core
Within iron and earth.

Knots of pink, fish-silvery
In heaven, in blue, blue heaven,
Soundless, bliss-full, wide-rayed, honey-bodied,
Red at the core,
Red at the core,
Knotted in heaven upon the fine light.

Open,
Open,
Five times wide open,
Six times wide open,
And given, and perfect;
And red at the core with the last sore-heartedness,
Sore-hearted-looking."

"At evening, sitting on this terrace,
When the sun from the west, beyond Pisa, beyond the mountains of Carrara
Departs, and the world is taken by surprise ...

When the tired flower of Florence is in gloom beneath the glowing
Brown hills surrounding ...

When under the arches of the Ponte Vecchio
A green light enters against stream, flush from the west,
Against the current of obscure Arno ...

Look up, and you see things flying
Between the day and the night;
Swallows with spools of dark thread sewing the shadows together.

A circle swoop, and a quick parabola under the bridge arches
Where light pushes through;
A sudden turning upon itself of a thing in the air.
A dip to the water.

And you think:
""The swallows are flying so late!""

Swallows?

Dark air-life looping
Yet missing the pure loop ...
A twitch, a twitter, an elastic shudder in flight
And serrated wings against the sky,
Like a glove, a black glove thrown up at the light,
And falling back.

Never swallows!
Bats!
The swallows are gone.

At a wavering instant the swallows gave way to bats
By the Ponte Vecchio ...
Changing guard.

Bats, and an uneasy creeping in one's scalp
As the bats swoop overhead!
Flying madly.

Pipistrello!
Black piper on an infinitesimal pipe.
Little lumps that fly in air and have voices indefinite, wildly vindictive;

Wings like bits of umbrella.

Bats!

Creatures that hang themselves up like an old rag, to sleep;
And disgustingly upside down.

Hanging upside down like rows of disgusting old rags
And grinning in their sleep.
Bats!

In China the bat is symbol for happiness.

Not for me!"
"Notes:
Then you shall see her truly--your blood remembering its first invasion of her secrecy, its first encounters with her kind, her chieftain lover...his shade that haunts the lakes and hills"

The bronze General Grant riding a bronze horse in Lincoln Park
Shrivels in the sun by day when the motor cars whirr by in long processions going somewhere to keep apppointment for dinner and matinees and buying and selling
Though in the dusk and nightfall when high waves are piling
On the slabs of the promenade along the lake shore near by
   I have seen the general dare the combers come closer
And make to ride his bronze horse out into the hoofs and guns of the storm.

II
I cross Lincoln Park on a winter night when the snow is falling.
Lincoln in bronze stands among the white lines of snow, his bronze forehead meeting soft echoes of the newsies crying forty thousand men are dead along the Yser, his bronze ears listening to the mumbled roar of the city at his bronze feet.
A lithe Indian on a bronze pony, Shakespeare seated with long legs in bronze, Garibaldi in a bronze cape, they hold places in the cold, lonely snow to-night on their pedestals and so they will hold them past midnight and into the dawn."

"Not in that wasted garden
Where bodies are drawn into grass
That feeds no flocks, and into evergreens
That bear no fruit 
There where along the shaded walks
Vain sighs are heard,
And vainer dreams are dreamed
Of close communion with departed souls 
But here under the apple tree
I loved and watched and pruned
With gnarled hands
In the long, long years;
Here under the roots of this northern-spy
To move in the chemic change and circle of life,
Into the soil and into the flesh of the tree,
And into the living epitaphs
Of redder apples!"
"What large, dark hands are those at the window
Lifted, grasping the golden light
Which weaves its way through the creeper leaves
       To my heart's delight?

Ah, only the leaves! But in the west,
In the west I see a redness come
Over the evening's burning breast 
        'Tis the wound of love goes home!

The woodbine creeps abroad
Calling low to her lover:
The sun-lit flirt who all the day
Has poised above her lips in play
And stolen kisses, shallow and gay
Of pollen, now has gone away
 She woos the moth with her sweet, low word,
And when above her his broad wings hover
Then her bright breast she will uncover
And yield her honey-drop to her lover.

Into the yellow, evening glow
Saunters a man from the farm below,
Leans, and looks in at the low-built shed
Where hangs the swallow's marriage bed.
The bird lies warm against the wall.
She glances quick her startled eyes
Towards him, then she turns away
Her small head, making warm display
Of red upon the throat. His terrors sway
Her out of the nest's warm, busy ball,
Whose plaintive cry is heard as she flies
In one blue stoop from out the sties
Into the evening's empty hall.

Oh, water-hen, beside the rushes
Hide your quaint, unfading blushes,
Still your quick tail, and lie as dead,
Till the distance folds over his ominous tread.

The rabbit presses back her ears,
Turns back her liquid, anguished eyes
And crouches low: then with wild spring
Spurts from the terror of his oncoming
To be choked back, the wire ring
Her frantic effort throttling:
Piteous brown ball of quivering fears!

Ah soon in his large, hard hands she dies,
And swings all loose to the swing of his walk.
Yet calm and kindly are his eyes
And ready to open in brown surprise
Should I not answer to his talk
Or should he my tears surmise.

I hear his hand on the latch, and rise from my chair
Watching the door open: he flashes bare
His strong teeth in a smile, and flashes his eyes
In a smile like triumph upon me; then careless-wise
He flings the rabbit soft on the table board
And comes towards me: ah, the uplifted sword
Of his hand against my bosom, and oh, the broad
Blade of his hand that raises my face to applaud
His coming: he raises up my face to him
And caresses my mouth with his fingers, which still smell grim
Of the rabbit's fur! God, I am caught in a snare!
I know not what fine wire is round my throat,
I only know I let him finger there
My pulse of life, letting him nose like a stoat
Who sniffs with joy before he drinks the blood:
And down his mouth comes to my mouth, and down
His dark bright eyes descend like a fiery hood
Upon my mind: his mouth meets mine, and a flood
Of sweet fire sweeps across me, so I drown
Within him, die, and find death good."

"See, the grass is full of stars,
Fallen in their brightness;
Hearts they have of shining gold,
Rays of shining whiteness.

Buttercups have honeyed hearts,
Bees they love the clover,
But I love the daisies' dance
All the meadow over.

Blow, O blow, you happy winds,
Singing summer's praises,
Up the field and down the field
A-dancing with the daisies."

"This spring as it comes bursts up in bonfires green,
Wild puffing of emerald trees, and flame-filled bushes,
Thorn-blossom lifting in wreaths of smoke between
Where the wood fumes up and the watery, flickering rushes.

I am amazed at this spring, this conflagration
Of green fires lit on the soil of the earth, this blaze
Of growing, and sparks that puff in wild gyration,
Faces of people streaming across my gaze.

And I, what fountain of fire am I among
This leaping combustion of spring? My spirit is tossed
About like a shadow buffeted in the throng
Of flames, a shadow that's gone astray, and is lost."
"I never knew the earth had so much gold
The fields run over with it, and this hill
Hoary and old,
Is young with buoyant blooms that flame and thrill.

Such golden fires, such yellowlo, how good
This spendthrift world, and what a lavish God!
This fringe of wood,
Blazing with buttercup and goldenrod.

You too, beloved, are changed. Again I see
Your face grow mystical, as on that night
You turned to me,
And all the trembling worldand youwere white.

Aye, you are touched; your singing lips grow dumb;
The fields absorb you, color you entire . . .
And you become
A goddess standing in a world of fire!"
"The fog comes
on little cat feet.

It sits looking
over harbor and city
on silent haunches
and then moves on."

"When she rises in the morning
I linger to watch her;
She spreads the bath-cloth underneath the window
And the sunbeams catch her
Glistening white on the shoulders,
While down her sides the mellow
Golden shadow glows as
She stoops to the sponge, and her swung breasts
Sway like full-blown yellow
Gloire de Dijon roses.

She drips herself with water, and her shoulders
Glisten as silver, they crumple up
Like wet and falling roses, and I listen
For the sluicing of their rain-dishevelled petals.
In the window full of sunlight
Concentrates her golden shadow
Fold on fold, until it glows as
Mellow as the glory roses."
"Pray why are you so bare, so bare,
   Oh, bough of the old oak-tree;
And why, when I go through the shade you throw,
   Runs a shudder over me?

My leaves were green as the best, I trow,
   And sap ran free in my veins,
But I say in the moonlight dim and weird
   A guiltless victim's pains.

I bent me down to hear his sigh;
   I shook with his gurgling moan,
And I trembled sore when they rode away,
   And left him here alone.

They'd charged him with the old, old crime,
   And set him fast in jail:
Oh, why does the dog howl all night long,
   And why does the night wind wail?

He prayed his prayer and he swore his oath,
   And he raised his hand to the sky;
But the beat of hoofs smote on his ear,
   And the steady tread drew nigh.

Who is it rides by night, by night,
   Over the moonlit road?
And what is the spur that keeps the pace,
   What is the galling goad?

And now they beat at the prison door,
   ""Ho, keeper, do not stay!
We are friends of him whom you hold within,
   And we fain would take him away

""From those who ride fast on our heels
   With mind to do him wrong;
They have no care for his innocence,
   And the rope they bear is long.""

They have fooled the jailer with lying words,
   They have fooled the man with lies;
The bolts unbar, the locks are drawn,
   And the great door open flies.

Now they have taken him from the jail,
   And hard and fast they ride,
And the leader laughs low down in his throat,
   As they halt my trunk beside.

Oh, the judge, he wore a mask of black,
   And the doctor one of white,
And the minister, with his oldest son,
   Was curiously bedight.

Oh, foolish man, why weep you now?
   'Tis but a little space,
And the time will come when these shall dread
   The mem'ry of your face.

I feel the rope against my bark,
   And the weight of him in my grain,
I feel in the throe of his final woe
   The touch of my own last pain.

And never more shall leaves come forth
   On the bough that bears the ban;
I am burned with dread, I am dried and dead,
   From the curse of a guiltless man.

And ever the judge rides by, rides by,
   And goes to hunt the deer,
And ever another rides his soul
   In the guise of a mortal fear.

And ever the man he rides me hard,
   And never a night stays he;
For I feel his curse as a haunted bough,
   On the trunk of a haunted tree."
"When I am dead and over me bright April
Shakes out her rain-drenched hair,
Tho' you should lean above me broken-hearted,
I shall not care.

I shall have peace, as leafy trees are peaceful
When rain bends down the bough,
And I shall be more silent and cold-hearted
Than you are now."
"in Just-
spring          when the world is mud-
luscious the little
lame balloonman

whistles          far          and wee

and eddieandbill come
running from marbles and
piracies and it's
spring

when the world is puddle-wonderful

the queer
old balloonman whistles
far          and             wee
and bettyandisbel come dancing

from hop-scotch and jump-rope and

it's
spring
and

         the

                  goat-footed

balloonMan          whistles
far
and
wee"
"I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,
And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made;
Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honey-bee,
And live alone in the bee-loud glade.

And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,
Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;
There midnights all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,
And evening full of the linnets wings.

I will arise and go now, for always night and day
I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;
While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,
I hear it in the deep hearts core."

"little tree
little silent Christmas tree
you are so little
you are more like a flower

who found you in the green forest
and were you very sorry to come away?
see          i will comfort you
because you smell so sweetly

i will kiss your cool bark
and hug you safe and tight
just as your mother would,
only don't be afraid

look          the spangles
that sleep all the year in a dark box
dreaming of being taken out and allowed to shine,
the balls the chains red and gold the fluffy threads,

put up your little arms
and i'll give them all to you to hold
every finger shall have its ring
and there won't be a single place dark or unhappy

then when you're quite dressed
you'll stand in the window for everyone to see
and how they'll stare!
oh but you'll be very proud

and my little sister and i will take hands
and looking up at our beautiful tree
we'll dance and sing

"We passed old farmer Boothby in the field.
Rugged and straight he stood; his body steeled
With stubbornness and age. We met his eyes
That never flinched or turned to compromise,
And Luck, he cried, good luck!and waved an arm,
Knotted and sailor-like, such as no farm
In all of Maine could boast of; and away
He turned again to pitch his new-cut hay...
We walked on leisurely until a bend
Showed him once more, now working toward the end
Of one great path; wearing his eighty years
Like banners lifted in a wind of cheers.

Then we turned off abruptlytook the road
Cutting the village, the one with the commanding
View of the river. And we strode
More briskly now to the long pier that showed
Where the frail boats were kept at Indian Landing.
In the canoe we stepped; our paddles dipped
Leisurely downwards, and the slim bark slipped
More on than in the water. Smoothly then
We shot its nose against the rippling current,
Feeling the rising rivers half-deterrent
Pull on the paddle as we turned the blade
To keep from swerving round; while we delayed
To watch the curious wave-eaten locks;
Or pass, with lazy turns, the picnic-rocks....
Blue eels flew under us, and fishes darted
A thousand ways; the once broad channel shrunk.
And over us the wise and noble-hearted
Twilight leaned down; the sunset mists were parted,
And we, with thoughts on tiptoe, slunk
Down the green, twisting alleys of the Kennebunk,

Motionless in the meadows
The trees, the rocks, the cows...
And quiet dripped from the shadows
Like rain from heavy boughs.

The tree-toads started ringing
Their ceaseless silver bells;
A land-locked breeze came swinging
Its censer of earthy smells.

The rivers tiny canon
Stretched into dusky lands;
Like a dark and silent companion
Evening held out her hands.

Hushed were the dawns bravados;
Loud noon was a silenced cry
And quiet slipped from the shadows
As stars slip out of the sky...

It must have been an hour more, or later,
When, tramping homeward through the piney wood,
We felt the years fly back; the brotherhood
Of forests took usand we saw the satyr!
There in a pool, up to his neck, he stood
And grinned to see us stare, incredulous
Too startled to remember fear or flight.
Feeling the menace in the crafty night,
We turned to runwhen lo, he called to us!
Using our very names he called. We drew
With creaking courage down the avenue
Of birches till we saw, with clearing sight,
(No longer through a tricky, pale-green light)
Familiar turns and shrubs, the friendly path,
And Farmer Boothby in his woodland bath!
The woods became his background; every tree
Seemed part of him, and stood erect, and shared
The beauty of that gnarled serenity;
The quiet vigor of age that smiled and squared
Its shoulders against Time ... And even night
Flowed in and out of him, as though content
With such a native element;
Happy to move about a spirit quite
As old, as placid and as confident...
Sideways we turned. Still glistening and unclad
He leaped up on the bank, light as a lad,
His body in the moonlight dripping stars...

We went on homeward, through the pasture-bars."
"Moonmoth and grasshopper that flee our page
And still wing on, untarnished of the name
We pinion to your bodies to assuage
Our envy of your freedomwe must maim

Because we are usurpers, and chagrined
And take the wing and scar it in the hand.
Names we have, even, to clap on the wind;
But we must die, as you, to understand.

I dreamed that all men dropped their names, and sang
As only they can praise, who build their days
With fin and hoof, with wing and sweetened fang
Struck free and holy in one Name always."

"She has no need to fear the fall
Of harvest from the laddered reach
Of orchards, nor the tide gone ebbing
      From the steep beach.

Nor hold to pain's effrontery
Her body's bulwark, stern and savage,
Nor be a glass, where to forsee
      Another's ravage.

What she has gathered, and what lost,
She will not find to lose again.
She is possessed by time, who once
      Was loved by men."
"I
The winter evening settles down
With smell of steaks in passageways.
Six oclock.
The burnt-out ends of smoky days.
And now a gusty shower wraps
The grimy scraps
Of withered leaves about your feet
And newspapers from vacant lots;
The showers beat
On broken blinds and chimney-pots,
And at the corner of the street
A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps.

And then the lighting of the lamps.

II
The morning comes to consciousness
Of faint stale smells of beer
From the sawdust-trampled street
With all its muddy feet that press
To early coffee-stands.
With the other masquerades
That time resumes,
One thinks of all the hands
That are raising dingy shades
In a thousand furnished rooms.

III
You tossed a blanket from the bed,
You lay upon your back, and waited;
You dozed, and watched the night revealing
The thousand sordid images
Of which your soul was constituted;
They flickered against the ceiling.
And when all the world came back
And the light crept up between the shutters
And you heard the sparrows in the gutters,
You had such a vision of the street
As the street hardly understands;
Sitting along the beds edge, where
You curled the papers from your hair,
Or clasped the yellow soles of feet
In the palms of both soiled hands.

IV
His soul stretched tight across the skies
That fade behind a city block,
Or trampled by insistent feet
At four and five and six oclock;
And short square fingers stuffing pipes,
And evening newspapers, and eyes
Assured of certain certainties,
The conscience of a blackened street
Impatient to assume the world.

I am moved by fancies that are curled
Around these images, and cling:
The notion of some infinitely gentle
Infinitely suffering thing.

Wipe your hand across your mouth, and laugh;
The worlds revolve like ancient women
Gathering fuel in vacant lots."
"The willows carried a slow sound,
A sarabande the wind mowed on the mead.
I could never remember
That seething, steady leveling of the marshes
Till age had brought me to the sea.

Flags, weeds. And remembrance of steep alcoves
Where cypresses shared the noons
Tyranny; they drew me into hades almost.
And mammoth turtles climbing sulphur dreams
Yielded, while sun-silt rippled them
Asunder ...

How much I would have bartered! the black gorge
And all the singular nestings in the hills
Where beavers learn stitch and tooth.
The pond I entered once and quickly fled
I remember now its singing willow rim.

And finally, in that memory all things nurse;
After the city that I finally passed
With scalding unguents spread and smoking darts
The monsoon cut across the delta
At gulf gates ... There, beyond the dykes

I heard wind flaking sapphire, like this summer,
And willows could not hold more steady sound."
"Twelve o'clock.
Along the reaches of the street
Held in a lunar synthesis,
Whispering lunar incantations
Dissolve the floors of memory
And all its clear relations,
Its divisions and precisions,
Every street lamp that I pass
Beats like a fatalistic drum,
And through the spaces of the dark
Midnight shakes the memory
As a madman shakes a dead geranium.

Half-past one,
The street lamp sputtered,
The street lamp muttered,
The street lamp said, ""Regard that woman
Who hesitates towards you in the light of the door
Which opens on her like a grin.
You see the border of her dress
Is torn and stained with sand,
And you see the corner of her eye
Twists like a crooked pin.""

The memory throws up high and dry
A crowd of twisted things;
A twisted branch upon the beach
Eaten smooth, and polished
As if the world gave up
The secret of its skeleton,
Stiff and white.
A broken spring in a factory yard,
Rust that clings to the form that the strength has left
Hard and curled and ready to snap.

Half-past two,
The street lamp said,
""Remark the cat which flattens itself in the gutter,
Slips out its tongue
And devours a morsel of rancid butter.""
So the hand of a child, automatic,
Slipped out and pocketed a toy that was running along the quay.
I could see nothing behind that child's eye.
I have seen eyes in the street
Trying to peer through lighted shutters,
And a crab one afternoon in a pool,
An old crab with barnacles on his back,
Gripped the end of a stick which I held him.

Half-past three,
The lamp sputtered,
The lamp muttered in the dark.

The lamp hummed:
""Regard the moon,
La lune ne garde aucune rancune,
She winks a feeble eye,
She smiles into corners.
She smoothes the hair of the grass.
The moon has lost her memory.
A washed-out smallpox cracks her face,
Her hand twists a paper rose,
That smells of dust and old Cologne,
She is alone
With all the old nocturnal smells
That cross and cross across her brain.""
The reminiscence comes
Of sunless dry geraniums
And dust in crevices,
Smells of chestnuts in the streets,
And female smells in shuttered rooms,
And cigarettes in corridors
And cocktail smells in bars.""

The lamp said,
""Four o'clock,
Here is the number on the door.
Memory!
You have the key,
The little lamp spreads a ring on the stair,
Mount.
The bed is open; the tooth-brush hangs on the wall,
Put your shoes at the door, sleep, prepare for life.""

The last twist of the knife."

"Out of the winds' and the waves' riot,
Out of the loud foam,
He has put in to a great quiet
And a still home.

Here he may lie at ease and wonder
Why the old ship waits,
And hark for the surge and the strong thunder
Of the full Straits,

And look for the fishing fleet at morning,
Shadows like lost souls,
Slide through the fog where the seal's warning
Betrays the shoals,

And watch for the deep-sea liner climbing
Out of the bright West,
With a salmon-sky and her wake shining
Like a tern's breast, 

And never know he is done for ever
With the old sea's pride,
Borne from the fight and the full endeavour
On an ebb tide."
"Maurice, weep not, I am not here under this pine tree.
The balmy air of spring whispers through the sweet grass,
The stars sparkle, the whippoorwill calls,
But thou grievest, while my soul lies rapturous
In the blest Nirvana of eternal light!
Go to the good heart that is my husband,
Who broods upon what he calls our guilty love: i
Tell him that my love for you, no less than my love for him
Wrought out my destiny i that through the flesh
I won spirit, and through spirit, peace.
There is no marriage in heaven,
But there is love."

"The earth builds on the earth
Castles and towers;
The earth saith of the earth:
All shall be ours.

Yea, though they plan and reap
The rye and the corn,
Lo, they were bond to Sleep
Ere they were born.

Yea, though the blind earth sows
For the fruit and the sheaf,
They shall harvest the leaf of the rose
And the dust of the leaf.

Pride of the sword and power
Are theirs at their need
Who shall rule but the root of the flower
The fall of the seed.

They who follow the flesh
In splendour and tears,
They shall rest and clothe them afresh
In the fulness of years.

From the dream of the dust they came
As the dawn set free.
They shall pass as the flower of the flame
Or the foam of the sea.

The earth builds on the earth
Castles and towers.
The earth saith of the earth:
All shall be ours."
"May I for my own self song's truth reckon,
Journey's jargon, how I in harsh days
Hardship endured oft.
Bitter breast-cares have I abided,
Known on my keel many a care's hold,
And dire sea-surge, and there I oft spent
Narrow nightwatch nigh the ship's head
While she tossed close to cliffs. Coldly afflicted,
My feet were by frost benumbed.
Chill its chains are; chafing sighs
Hew my heart round and hunger begot
Mere-weary mood. Lest man know not
That he on dry land loveliest liveth,
List how I, care-wretched, on ice-cold sea,
Weathered the winter, wretched outcast
Deprived of my kinsmen;
Hung with hard ice-flakes, where hail-scur flew,
There I heard naught save the harsh sea
And ice-cold wave, at whiles the swan cries,
Did for my games the gannet's clamour,
Sea-fowls, loudness was for me laughter,
The mews' singing all my mead-drink.
Storms, on the stone-cliffs beaten, fell on the stern
In icy feathers; full oft the eagle screamed
With spray on his pinion.
Not any protector
May make merry man faring needy.
This he little believes, who aye in winsome life
Abides 'mid burghers some heavy business,
Wealthy and wine-flushed, how I weary oft
Must bide above brine.
Neareth nightshade, snoweth from north,
Frost froze the land, hail fell on earth then
Corn of the coldest. Nathless there knocketh now
The heart's thought that I on high streams
The salt-wavy tumult traverse alone.
Moaneth alway my mind's lust
That I fare forth, that I afar hence
Seek out a foreign fastness.
For this there's no mood-lofty man over earth's midst,
Not though he be given his good, but will have in his youth greed;
Nor his deed to the daring, nor his king to the faithful
But shall have his sorrow for sea-fare
Whatever his lord will.
He hath not heart for harping, nor in ring-having
Nor winsomeness to wife, nor world's delight
Nor any whit else save the wave's slash,
Yet longing comes upon him to fare forth on the water.
Bosque taketh blossom, cometh beauty of berries,
Fields to fairness, land fares brisker,
All this admonisheth man eager of mood,
The heart turns to travel so that he then thinks
On flood-ways to be far departing.
Cuckoo calleth with gloomy crying,
He singeth summerward, bodeth sorrow,
The bitter heart's blood. Burgher knows not 
He the prosperous man  what some perform
Where wandering them widest draweth.
So that but now my heart burst from my breast-lock,
My mood 'mid the mere-flood,
Over the whale's acre, would wander wide.
On earth's shelter cometh oft to me,
Eager and ready, the crying lone-flyer,
Whets for the whale-path the heart irresistibly,
O'er tracks of ocean; seeing that anyhow
My lord deems to me this dead life
On loan and on land, I believe not
That any earth-weal eternal standeth
Save there be somewhat calamitous
That, ere a man's tide go, turn it to twain.
Disease or oldness or sword-hate
Beats out the breath from doom-gripped body.
And for this, every earl whatever, for those speaking after 
Laud of the living, boasteth some last word,
That he will work ere he pass onward,
Frame on the fair earth 'gainst foes his malice,
Daring ado, ...
So that all men shall honour him after
And his laud beyond them remain 'mid the English,
Aye, for ever, a lasting life's-blast,
Delight mid the doughty.
Days little durable,
And all arrogance of earthen riches,
There come now no kings nor Csars
Nor gold-giving lords like those gone.
Howe'er in mirth most magnified,
Whoe'er lived in life most lordliest,
Drear all this excellence, delights undurable!
Waneth the watch, but the world holdeth.
Tomb hideth trouble. The blade is layed low.
Earthly glory ageth and seareth.
No man at all going the earth's gait,
But age fares against him, his face paleth,
Grey-haired he groaneth, knows gone companions,
Lordly men are to earth o'ergiven,
Nor may he then the flesh-cover, whose life ceaseth,
Nor eat the sweet nor feel the sorry,
Nor stir hand nor think in mid heart,
And though he strew the grave with gold,
His born brothers, their buried bodies
Be an unlikely treasure hoard."
"Out in the sky the great dark clouds are massing;
I look far out into the pregnant night,
Where I can hear a solemn booming gun
And catch the gleaming of a random light,
That tells me that the ship I seek is passing, passing.

My tearful eyes my soul's deep hurt are glassing;
For I would hail and check that ship of ships.
I stretch my hands imploring, cry aloud,
My voice falls dead a foot from mine own lips,
And but its ghost doth reach that vessel, passing, passing.

O Earth, O Sky, O Ocean, both surpassing,
O heart of mine, O soul that dreads the dark!
Is there no hope for me? Is there no way
That I may sight and check that speeding bark
Which out of sight and sound is passing, passing?"
"Air a-gittin' cool an' coolah,
   Frost a-comin' in de night,
Hicka' nuts an' wa'nuts fallin',
   Possum keepin' out o' sight.

"The brawling of a sparrow in the eaves,   
The brilliant moon and all the milky sky,   
And all that famous harmony of leaves,   
Had blotted out man's image and his cry.

A girl arose that had red mournful lips
And seemed the greatness of the world in tears,   
Doomed like Odysseus and the labouring ships   
And proud as Priam murdered with his peers;

Arose, and on the instant clamorous eaves,   
A climbing moon upon an empty sky,   
And all that lamentation of the leaves,   
Could but compose man's image and his cry."
"Now in the West the slender moon lies low,
And now Orion glimmers through the trees,
Clearing the earth with even pace and slow,
And now the stately-moving Pleiades,
In that soft infinite darkness overhead
Hang jewel-wise upon a silver thread.

And all the lonelier stars that have their place,
Calm lamps within the distant southern sky,
And planet-dust upon the edge of space,
Look down upon the fretful world, and I
Look up to outer vastness unafraid
And see the stars which sang when earth was made."

"I spot the hills
With yellow balls in autumn.
I light the prairie cornfields
Orange and tawny gold clusters
And I am called pumpkins.
On the last of October
When dusk is fallen
Children join hands
And circle round me
Singing ghost songs
And love to the harvest moon;
I am a jack-o'-lantern
With terrible teeth
And the children know
I am fooling."
"Green miles of leafy peace are spread
Over these ranks, unseen and serried;
Screening the trenches with their dead
And living men already buried.
The rains beat down, the torrents flow
Into each cold and huddling cave;
And over them the beet-fields grow,
A fortress gentle as a grave.

Morose, impatient, sick at heart,
With rasping nerves and twitching muscles,
We cannot even sleep; we start
With every twig that snaps or rustles.
Sought always by an unseen foe
Over our heads the bullets fly;
But more than these, we fear the snow,
The silent shrapnel of the sky.

Yonder our colonel stalks and grieves,
Meeting the storm with thoughts more stormy;
But we, we sit and watch the leaves
Fall down, a torn and crumpled army.
We mourn for every leaf that lies,
As though it were a comrade slain;
Each was a shelter from the eyes
Of every prying aeroplane. . . 

And in its cloudy uniform,
Stilling the cannons earthly thunder,
The huge artillery of the storm
Plows through the land and pulls it under.
The rain beats down, until the slow
And slipping earth resists no more. . .
And over them the beets will grow
Ranker and redder than before."

"[Version 1: 1921]
The quick sparks on the gorse bushes are leaping,
Little jets of sunlight-texture imitating flame;
Above them, exultant, the peewits are sweeping:
They are lords of the desolate wastes of sadness their screamings proclaim.

Rabbits, handfuls of brown earth, lie
Low-rounded on the mournful grass they have bitten down to the quick.
Are they asleep?  Are they alive?  Now see, when I
Move my arms the hill bursts and heaves under their spurting kick.

The common flaunts bravely; but below, from the rushes
Crowds of glittering king-cups surge to challenge the blossoming bushes;
There the lazy streamlet pushes
Its curious course mildly; here it wakes again, leaps, laughs, and gushes.

Into a deep pond, an old sheep-dip,
Dark, overgrown with willows, cool, with the brook ebbing through so slow,
Naked on the steep, soft lip
Of the bank I stand watching my own white shadow quivering to and fro.

What if the gorse flowers shrivelled and kissing were lost?
Without the pulsing waters, where were the marigolds and the songs of the brook!
If my veins and my breasts with love embossed
Withered, my insolent soul would be gone like flowers that the hot wind took.

So my soul like a passionate woman turns,
Filled with remorseful terror to the man she scorned, and her love
For myself in my own eyes' laughter burns,
Runs ecstatic over the pliant folds rippling down to my belly from the breast-lights above.

Over my sunlit skin the warm, clinging air,
Rich with the songs of seven larks singing at once, goes kissing me glad.
And the soul of the wind and my blood compare
Their wandering happiness, and the wind, wasted in liberty, drifts on and is sad.

Oh but the water loves me and folds me,
Plays with me, sways me, lifts me and sinks me as though it were living blood,
Blood of a heaving woman who holds me,
Owning my supple body a rare glad thing, supremely good.

[Version 2: 1928]
The quick sparks on the gorse-bushes are leaping
Little jets of sunlight texture imitating flame;
Above them, exultant, the peewits are sweeping:
They have triumphed again o'er the ages, their screamings proclaim.

Rabbits, handfuls of brown earth, lie
Low-rounded on the mournful turf they have bitten down to the quick.
Are they asleep?  are they living?  Now see, when I
Lift my arms, the hill bursts and heaves under their spurting kick!

The common flaunts bravely; but below, from the rushes
Crowds of glittering king-cups surge to challenge the blossoming bushes;
There the lazy streamlet pushes
His bent course mildly; here wakes again, leaps, laughs, and gushes

Into a deep pond, an old sheep-dip,
Dark, overgrown with willows, cool, with the brook ebbing through so slow;
Naked on the steep, soft lip
Of the turf I stand watching my own white shadow quivering to and fro.

What if the gorse-flowers shrivelled, and I were gone?
What if the waters ceased, where were the marigolds then, and the gudgeon?
What is this thing that I look down upon?
White on the water wimples my shadow, strains like a dog on a string, to run on.

How it looks back, like a white dog to its master!
I on the bank all substance, my shadow all shadow looking up to me, looking back!
And the water runs, and runs faster, runs faster,
And the white dog dances and quivers, I am holding his cord quite slack.

But how splendid it is to be substance, here!
My shadow is neither here nor there; but I, I am royally here!
I am here! I am here! screams the peewit; the may-blobs burst out in a laugh as they hear!
Here! flick the rabbits. Here! pants the gorse. Here! say the insects far and near.

Over my skin in the sunshine, the warm, clinging air
Flushed with the songs of seven larks singing at once, goes kissing me glad.
You are here! You are here! We have found you! Everywhere
We sought you substantial, you touchstone of caresses, you naked lad!

Oh but the water loves me and folds me,
Plays with me, sways me, lifts me and sinks me, murmurs: Oh marvellous stuff!
No longer shadow!  and it holds me
Close, and it rolls me, enfolds me, touches me, as if never it could touch me enough.

Sun, but in substance, yellow water-blobs!
Wings and feathers on the crying, mysterious ages, peewits wheeling!
All that is right, all that is good; all that is God takes substance! a rabbit lobs
In confirmation, I hear sevenfold lark-songs pealing."
"The trees are in their autumn beauty,
The woodland paths are dry,
Under the October twilight the water
Mirrors a still sky;
Upon the brimming water among the stones
Are nine-and-fifty swans.

The nineteenth autumn has come upon me
Since I first made my count;
I saw, before I had well finished,
All suddenly mount
And scatter wheeling in great broken rings
Upon their clamorous wings.

I have looked upon those brilliant creatures,
And now my heart is sore.
All's changed since I, hearing at twilight,
The first time on this shore,
The bell-beat of their wings above my head,
Trod with a lighter tread.

Unwearied still, lover by lover,
They paddle in the cold
Companionable streams or climb the air;
Their hearts have not grown old;
Passion or conquest, wander where they will,
Attend upon them still.

But now they drift on the still water,
Mysterious, beautiful;
Among what rushes will they build,
By what lake's edge or pool
Delight men's eyes when I awake some day
To find they have flown away?"
"Give me hunger,
O you gods that sit and give
The world its orders.
Give me hunger, pain and want,
Shut me out with shame and failure
From your doors of gold and fame,
Give me your shabbiest, weariest hunger!

But leave me a little love,
A voice to speak to me in the day end,
A hand to touch me in the dark room
Breaking the long loneliness.
In the dusk of day-shapes
Blurring the sunset,
One little wandering, western star
Thrust out from the changing shores of shadow.
Let me go to the window,
Watch there the day-shapes of dusk
And wait and know the coming
Of a little love."
"Passing through huddled and ugly walls,
By doorways where women haggard
Looked from their hunger-deep eyes,
Haunted with shadows of hunger-hands,
Out from the huddled and ugly walls,
I came sudden, at the city's edge,
On a blue burst of lake,
Long lake waves breaking under the sun
On a spray-flung curve of shore;
And a fluttering storm of gulls,
Masses of great gray wings
And flying white bellies
Veering and wheeling free in the open."
"Desolate and lone
All night long on the lake
Where fog trails and mist creeps,
The whistle of a boat
Calls and cries unendingly,
Like some lost child
In tears and trouble
Hunting the harbor's breast
And the harbor's eyes."
"Momus is the name men give your face,
The brag of its tone, like a long low steamboat whistle
Finding a way mid mist on a shoreland,
Where gray rocks let the salt water shatter spray Against horizons purple, silent.

Yes, Momus,
Men have flung your face in bronze
To gaze in gargoyle downward on a street-whirl of folk.
They were artists did this, shaped your sad mouth,
Gave you a tall forehead slanted with calm, broad wisdom;
All your lips to the corners and your cheeks to the high bones
Thrown over and through with a smile that forever wishes and wishes, purple, silent, fled from all the iron things of life, evaded like a sought bandit, gone into dreams, by God.

I wonder, Momus,
Whether shadows of the dead sit somewhere and look with deep laughter
On men who play in terrible earnest the old, known, solemn repetitions of history.
A droning monotone soft as sea laughter hovers from your kindliness of bronze,
You give me the human ease of a mountain peak, purple, silent;
Granite shoulders heaving above the earth curves,
Careless eye-witness of the spawning tides of men and women
Swarming always in a drift of millions to the dust of toil, the salt of tears,
And blood drops of undiminishing war."
"I shall foot it
Down the roadway in the dusk,
Where shapes of hunger wander
And the fugitives of pain go by.

I shall foot it
In the silence of the morning,
See the night slur into dawn,
Hear the slow great winds arise
Where tall trees flank the way
And shoulder toward the sky.

The broken boulders by the road
Shall not commemorate my ruin.
Regret shall be the gravel under foot.
I shall watch for
Slim birds swift of wing
That go where wind and ranks of thunder
Drive the wild processionals of rain.

The dust of the travelled road
Shall touch my hands and face."
"I have sat here happy in the gardens,
Watching the still pool and the reeds
And the dark clouds
Which the wind of the upper air
Tore like the green leafy boughs
Of the divers-hued trees of late summer;
But though I greatly delight
In these and the water-lilies,
That which sets me nighest to weeping
Is the rose and white color of the smooth flag-stones,
And the pale yellow grasses
Among them."
"Potuia, potuia
White grave goddess,
Pity my sadness,
O silence of Paros.

I am not of these about thy feet,
These garments and decorum;
I am thy brother,
Thy lover of aforetime crying to thee,
And thou hearest me not.

I have whispered thee in thy solitudes
Of our loves in Phrygia,
The far ecstasy of burning noons
When the fragile pipes
Ceased in the cypress shade,
And the brown fingers of the shepherd
Moved over slim shoulders;
And only the cicada sang.

I have told thee of the hills
And the lisp of reeds
And the sun upon thy breasts,

And thou hearest me not,
Potuia, potuia
Thou hearest me not."
"The ancient songs
Pass deathward mournfully.

Cold lips that sing no more, and withered wreaths,
Regretful eyes, and drooping breasts and wings
Symbols of ancient songs
Mournfully passing
Down to the great white surges,
Watched of none         - -
Save the frail sea-birds
And the lithe pale girls,
Daughters of Okeanos.

And the songs pass
From the green land
Which lies upon the waves as a leaf
On the flowers of hyacinth;
And they pass from the waters,
The manifold winds and the dim moon,
And they come,
Silently winging through soft Kimmerian dusk,
To the quiet level lands
That she keeps for us all,
That she wrought for us all for sleep
In the silver days of the earth's dawning
Proserpine, daughter of Zeus.

And we turn from the Kuprian's breasts,
And we turn from thee,
Phoibos Apollon,
And we turn from the music of old
And the hills that we loved and the meads,
And we turn from the fiery day,
And the lips that were over-sweet;
For silently
Brushing the fields with red-shod feet,
With purple robe
Searing the flowers as with a sudden flame,
Death,
Thou hast come upon us.

And of all the ancient songs
Passing to the swallow-blue halls
By the dark streams of Persephone,
This only remains:
That in the end we turn to thee,
Death,
That we turn to thee, singing
One last song.

O Death,
Thou art an healing wind
That blowest over white flowers
A-tremble with dew;
Thou art a wind flowing
Over long leagues of lonely sea;
Thou art the dusk and the fragrance;
Thou art the lips of love mournfully smiling;
Thou art the pale peace of one
Satiate with old desires;
Thou art the silence of beauty,
And we look no more for the morning;
We yearn no more for the sun,
Since with thy white hands,
Death,
Thou crownest us with the pallid chaplets,
The slim colorless poppies
Which in thy garden alone
Softly thou gatherest.

And silently;
And with slow feet approaching;
And with bowed head and unlit eyes,
We kneel before thee:
And thou, leaning towards us, Caressingly layest upon us
Flowers from thy thin cold hands,
And, smiling as a chaste woman Knowing love in her heart,
Thou sealest our eyes
And the illimitable quietude
Comes gently upon us."

"Knowlt Hoheimer ran away to the war
The day before Curl Trenary
Swore out a warrant through Justice Arnett
For stealing hogs.
But that's not the reason he turned a soldier.
He caught me running with Lucius Atherton.
We quarreled and I told him never again
To cross my path.
Then he stole the hogs and went to the war
Back of every soldier is a woman."
"He protested all his life long
The newspapers lied about him villainously;
That he was not at fault for Minerva's fall,
But only tried to help her.
Poor soul so sunk in sin he could not see
That even trying to help her, as he called it,
He had broken the law human and divine.
Passers by, an ancient admonition to you:
If your ways would be ways of pleasantness,
And all your pathways peace,
Love God and keep his commandments."

"Were you but lying cold and dead,
And lights were paling out of the West,
You would come hither, and bend your head,
And I would lay my head on your breast;
And you would murmur tender words,
Forgiving me, because you were dead:
Nor would you rise and hasten away,
Though you have the will of wild birds,
But know your hair was bound and wound
About the stars and moon and sun:
O would, beloved, that you lay
Under the dock-leaves in the ground,
While lights were paling one by one."
"Never give all the heart, for love
Will hardly seem worth thinking of
To passionate women if it seem
Certain, and they never dream
That it fades out from kiss to kiss;
For everything thats lovely is
But a brief, dreamy, kind delight.
O never give the heart outright,
For they, for all smooth lips can say,
Have given their hearts up to the play.
And who could play it well enough
If deaf and dumb and blind with love?
He that made this knows all the cost,
For he gave all his heart and lost."
"Why should I blame her that she filled my days
With misery, or that she would of late
Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways,
Or hurled the little streets upon the great,
Had they but courage equal to desire?
What could have made her peaceful with a mind
That nobleness made simple as a fire,
With beauty like a tightened bow, a kind
That is not natural in an age like this,
Being high and solitary and most stern?
Why, what could she have done, being what she is?
Was there another Troy for her to burn?"
"Some may have blamed you that you took away
The verses that could move them on the day
When, the ears being deafened, the sight of the eyes blind
With lightning, you went from me, and I could find
Nothing to make a song about but kings,
Helmets, and swords, and half-forgotten things
That were like memories of youbut now
We'll out, for the world lives as long ago;
And while we're in our laughing, weeping fit,
Hurl helmets, crowns, and swords into the pit.
But, dear, cling close to me; since you were gone,
My barren thoughts have chilled me to the bone."
"Shy one, shy one,
Shy one of my heart,
She moves in the firelight
Pensively apart.

She carries in the dishes,
And lays them in a row.
To an isle in the water
With her would I go.

She carries in the candles,
And lights the curtained room,
Shy in the doorway
And shy in the gloom;

And shy as a rabbit,
Helpful and shy.
To an isle in the water
With her would I fly."
"I feel the spring far off, far off,
    The faint, far scent of bud and leaf
Oh, how can spring take heart to come
    To a world in grief,
    Deep grief?
 
The sun turns north, the days grow long,
    Later the evening star grows bright
How can the daylight linger on
    For men to fight,
    Still fight?
 
The grass is waking in the ground,
    Soon it will rise and blow in waves
How can it have the heart to sway
    Over the graves,
    New graves?
 
Under the boughs where lovers walked
    The apple-blooms will shed their breath
But what of all the lovers now
    Parted by Death,
    Grey Death?"
"Lying in dug-outs, joking idly, wearily;
   Watching the candle guttering in the draught;
Hearing the great shells go high over us, eerily
   Singing; how often have I turned over, and laughed
 
With pity and pride, photographs of all colours,
   All sizes, subjects: khaki brothers in France;
Or mother's faces worn with countless dolours;
   Or girls whose eyes were challenging and must dance,
 
Though in a picture only, a common cheap
   Ill-taken card; and childrenfrozen, some
(Babies) waiting on Dicky-bird to peep
   Out of the handkerchief that is his home
 
(But he's so shy!). And some with bright looks, calling
   Delight across the miles of land and sea,
That not the dread of barrage suddenly falling
   Could quite blot outnot mud nor lethargy.
 
Smiles and triumphant careless laughter. O
   The pain of them, wide Earth's most sacred things! 
Lying in dug-outs, hearing the great shells slow
   Sailing mile-high, the heart mounts higher and sings.
 
But onceO why did he keep that bitter token
   Of a dead Love?that boy, who, suddenly moved,
Showed me, his eyes wet, his low talk broken,
   A girl who better had not been beloved."
"I went out to the hazel wood,
Because a fire was in my head,
And cut and peeled a hazel wand,
And hooked a berry to a thread;
And when white moths were on the wing,
And moth-like stars were flickering out,
I dropped the berry in a stream
And caught a little silver trout.

When I had laid it on the floor
I went to blow the fire a-flame,
But something rustled on the floor,
And someone called me by my name:
It had become a glimmering girl
With apple blossom in her hair
Who called me by my name and ran
And faded through the brightening air.

Though I am old with wandering
Through hollow lands and hilly lands,
I will find out where she has gone,
And kiss her lips and take her hands;
And walk among long dappled grass,
And pluck till time and times are done,
The silver apples of the moon,
The golden apples of the sun."
"Now that I know
That passion warms little
Of flesh in the mold,
And treasure is brittle,

Ill lie here and learn
How, over their ground,
Trees make a long shadow
And a light sound.

from Dana, 1904
"The moon has left the sky, love,
The stars are hiding now,
And frowning on the world, love,
Night bares her sable brow.

The snow is on the ground, love,
And cold and keen the air is.
Im singing here to you, love;
Youre dreaming there in Paris.

But this is Natures law, love,
Though just it may not seem,
That men should wake to sing, love;
While maidens sleep and dream.

Them care may not molest, love,
Nor stir them from their slumbers,
Though midnight find the swain, love.
Still halting oer his numbers.

I watch the rosy dawn, love,
Come stealing up the east,
While all things round rejoice, love,
That Night her reign has ceased.

The lark will soon be heard, love,
And on his way be winging;
When Natures poets, wake, love,
Why should a man be singing?"
"Thou art my lute, by thee I sing,
     My being is attuned to thee.
Thou settest all my words a-wing,
     And meltest me to melody.
 
Thou art my life, by thee I live,
     From thee proceed the joys I know;
Sweetheart, thy hand has power to give
     The meed of lovethe cup of woe.
 
Thou art my love, by thee I lead
     My soul the paths of light along,
From vale to vale, from mead to mead,
     And home it in the hills of song.
 
My song, my soul, my life, my all,
     Why need I pray or make my plea,
Since my petition cannot fall;
     For Im already one with thee!"
"Wine comes in at the mouth
And love comes in at the eye;
Thats all we shall know for truth
Before we grow old and die.
I lift the glass to my mouth,
I look at you, and I sigh."
"Bilbea, I was in Babylon on Saturday night.
I saw nothing of you anywhere.
I was at the old place and the other girls were there,
But no Bilbea.

Have you gone to another house? or city?
Why dont you write?
I was sorry. I walked home half-sick.

Tell me how it goes.
Send me some kind of a letter.
And take care of yourself."
"How much do you love me, a million bushels?
Oh, a lot more than that, Oh, a lot more.

And tomorrow maybe only half a bushel?
Tomorrow maybe not even a half a bushel.

And is this your heart arithmetic?
This is the way the wind measures the weather."

"                                  1 

When the world turns completely upside down
You say well emigrate to the Eastern Shore
Aboard a river-boat from Baltimore;
Well live among wild peach trees, miles from town,
Youll wear a coonskin cap, and I a gown
Homespun, dyed butternuts dark gold color.
Lost, like your lotus-eating ancestor,
Well swim in milk and honey till we drown.

The winter will be short, the summer long,
The autumn amber-hued, sunny and hot,
Tasting of cider and of scuppernong;
All seasons sweet, but autumn best of all.
The squirrels in their silver fur will fall
Like falling leaves, like fruit, before your shot.


                                  2 

The autumn frosts will lie upon the grass
Like bloom on grapes of purple-brown and gold.
The misted early mornings will be cold;
The little puddles will be roofed with glass.
The sun, which burns from copper into brass,
Melts these at noon, and makes the boys unfold
Their knitted mufflers; full as they can hold
Fat pockets dribble chestnuts as they pass.

Peaches grow wild, and pigs can live in clover;
A barrel of salted herrings lasts a year;
The spring begins before the winters over.
By February you may find the skins
Of garter snakes and water moccasins
Dwindled and harsh, dead-white and cloudy-clear.


                                  3 

When April pours the colors of a shell
Upon the hills, when every little creek
Is shot with silver from the Chesapeake
In shoals new-minted by the ocean swell,
When strawberries go begging, and the sleek
Blue plums lie open to the blackbirds beak,
We shall live well  we shall live very well.

The months between the cherries and the peaches
Are brimming cornucopias which spill
Fruits red and purple, sombre-bloomed and black;
Then, down rich fields and frosty river beaches
Well trample bright persimmons, while you kill
Bronze partridge, speckled quail, and canvasback.


                                  4 

Down to the Puritan marrow of my bones
Theres something in this richness that I hate.
I love the look, austere, immaculate,
Of landscapes drawn in pearly monotones.
Theres something in my very blood that owns
Bare hills, cold silver on a sky of slate,
A thread of water, churned to milky spate
Streaming through slanted pastures fenced with stones.

I love those skies, thin blue or snowy gray,
Those fields sparse-planted, rendering meagre sheaves;
That spring, briefer than apple-blossoms breath,
Summer, so much too beautiful to stay,
Swift autumn, like a bonfire of leaves,
And sleepy winter, like the sleep of death."

"Suddenly discovering in the eyes of the very beautiful
                            Normande cocotte
The eyes of the very learned British Museum assistant."
"We sat together at one summers end,
That beautiful mild woman, your close friend,   
And you and I, and talked of poetry.
I said, A line will take us hours maybe;
Yet if it does not seem a moments thought,   
Our stitching and unstitching has been naught.   
Better go down upon your marrow-bones   
And scrub a kitchen pavement, or break stones   
Like an old pauper, in all kinds of weather;   
For to articulate sweet sounds together
Is to work harder than all these, and yet   
Be thought an idler by the noisy set
Of bankers, schoolmasters, and clergymen   
The martyrs call the world.
                                          And thereupon
That beautiful mild woman for whose sake   
Theres many a one shall find out all heartache   
On finding that her voice is sweet and low   
Replied, To be born woman is to know
Although they do not talk of it at school
That we must labour to be beautiful.
I said, Its certain there is no fine thing   
Since Adams fall but needs much labouring.
There have been lovers who thought love should be   
So much compounded of high courtesy   
That they would sigh and quote with learned looks   
Precedents out of beautiful old books;   
Yet now it seems an idle trade enough.

We sat grown quiet at the name of love;   
We saw the last embers of daylight die,   
And in the trembling blue-green of the sky   
A moon, worn as if it had been a shell   
Washed by times waters as they rose and fell   
About the stars and broke in days and years.

I had a thought for no ones but your ears:   
That you were beautiful, and that I strove   
To love you in the old high way of love;
That it had all seemed happy, and yet wed grown   
As weary-hearted as that hollow moon."
"I wanted you, nameless Woman of the South,
No wraith, but utterlyas still more alone
The Southern Cross takes night
And lifts her girdles from her, one by one
High, cool,
wide from the slowly smoldering fire
Of lower heavens,
vaporous scars!

Eve! Magdalene!
or Mary, you?

Whatever callfalls vainly on the wave.
O simian Venus, homeless Eve,
Unwedded, stumbling gardenless to grieve
Windswept guitars on lonely decks forever;
Finally to answer all within one grave!

And this long wake of phosphor,
iridescent
Furrow of all our traveltrailed derision!
Eyes crumble at its kiss. Its long-drawn spell
Incites a yell. Slid on that backward vision
The mind is churned to spittle, whispering hell.

I wanted you . . . The embers of the Cross
Climbed by aslant and huddling aromatically.
It is blood to remember; it is fire
To stammer back . . . It is
Godyour namelessness. And the wash

All night the water combed you with black
Insolence. You crept out simmering, accomplished.
Water rattled that stinging coil, your
Rehearsed hairdocile, alas, from many arms.
Yes, Evewraith of my unloved seed!

The Cross, a phantom, buckleddropped below the dawn.
Light drowned the lithic trillions of your spawn."

"Down by the salley gardens
   my love and I did meet;
She passed the salley gardens
   with little snow-white feet.
She bid me take love easy,
   as the leaves grow on the tree;
But I, being young and foolish,
   with her would not agree.

In a field by the river
   my love and I did stand,
And on my leaning shoulder
   she laid her snow-white hand.
She bid me take life easy,
   as the grass grows on the weirs;
But I was young and foolish,
   and now am full of tears.

"You dweller in the dark cabin,
To whom the watermelon is always purple,   
Whose garden is wind and moon,

Of the two dreams, night and day,
What lover, what dreamer, would choose   
The one obscured by sleep?

Here is the plantain by your door   
And the best cock of red feather   
That crew before the clocks.

A feme may come, leaf-green,   
Whose coming may give revel   
Beyond revelries of sleep,

Yes, and the blackbird spread its tail,   
So that the sun may speckle,   
While it creaks hail.

You dweller in the dark cabin,   
Rise, since rising will not waken,   
And hail, cry hail, cry hail."

"Come when the nights are bright with stars
Or come when the moon is mellow;
Come when the sun his golden bars
Drops on the hay-field yellow.
Come in the twilight soft and gray,
Come in the night or come in the day,
Come, O love, wheneer you may,
And you are welcome, welcome.

You are sweet, O Love, dear Love,
You are soft as the nesting dove.
Come to my heart and bring it to rest
As the bird flies home to its welcome nest.

Come when my heart is full of grief
Or when my heart is merry;
Come with the falling of the leaf
Or with the reddning cherry.
Come when the years first blossom blows,
Come when the summer gleams and glows,
Come with the winters drifting snows,
And you are welcome, welcome."

"While my hair was still cut straight across my forehead
I played about the front gate, pulling flowers.
You came by on bamboo stilts, playing horse,
You walked about my seat, playing with blue plums.
And we went on living in the village of Chokan:
Two small people, without dislike or suspicion.
At fourteen I married My Lord you.
I never laughed, being bashful.
Lowering my head, I looked at the wall.
Called to, a thousand times, I never looked back.

At fifteen I stopped scowling,
I desired my dust to be mingled with yours
Forever and forever, and forever.
Why should I climb the look out?

At sixteen you departed
You went into far Ku-to-en, by the river of swirling eddies,
And you have been gone five months.
The monkeys make sorrowful noise overhead.

You dragged your feet when you went out.
By the gate now, the moss is grown, the different mosses,
Too deep to clear them away!
The leaves fall early this autumn, in wind.
The paired butterflies are already yellow with August
Over the grass in the West garden;
They hurt me.
I grow older.
If you are coming down through the narrows of the river Kiang,
Please let me know beforehand,
And I will come out to meet you
As far as Cho-fu-Sa."
"Since there is no escape, since at the end
My body will be utterly destroyed,
This hand I love as I have loved a friend,
This body I tended, wept with and enjoyed;
Since there is no escape even for me
Who love life with a love too sharp to bear:
The scent of orchards in the rain, the sea
And hours alone too still and sure for prayer
Since darkness waits for me, then all the more
Let me go down as waves sweep to the shore
In pride, and let me sing with my last breath;
In these few hours of light I lift my head;
Life is my loverI shall leave the dead
If there is any way to baffle death."

"Too high, too high to pluck
My heart shall swing.
A fruit no bee shall suck,
No wasp shall sting.

If on some night of cold
It falls to ground
In apple-leaves of gold
Ill wrap it round.

And I shall seal it up
With spice and salt,
In a carven silver cup,
In a deep vault.

Before my eyes are blind
And my lips mute,
I must eat core and rind
Of that same fruit.

Before my heart is dust
At the end of all,
Eat it I must, I must
Were it bitter gall.

But I shall keep it sweet
By some strange art;
Wild honey I shall eat
When I eat my heart.

O honey cool and chaste
As clovers breath!
Sweet Heaven I shall taste
Before my death."
"When the first dark had fallen around them
And the leaves were weary of praise,
In the clear silence Beauty found them
And shewed them all her ways.

In the high noon of the heavenly garden
Where the angels sunned with the birds,
Beauty, before their hearts could harden,
Had taught them heavenly words.

When they fled in the burning weather
And nothing dawned but a dream,
Beauty fasted their hands together
And cooled them at her stream.

And when day wearied and night grew stronger,
And they slept as the beautiful must,
Then she bided a little longer,
And blossomed from their dust."
"My love looks like a girl to-night,
      But she is old.
The plaits that lie along her pillow
      Are not gold,
But threaded with filigree silver,
      And uncanny cold.

She looks like a young maiden, since her brow
      Is smooth and fair,
Her cheeks are very smooth, her eyes are closed.
      She sleeps a rare
Still winsome sleep, so still, and so composed.

Nay, but she sleeps like a bride, and dreams her dreams
      Of perfect things.
She lies at last, the darling, in the shape of her dream,
      And her dead mouth sings
By its shape, like the thrushes in clear evenings."
"The jester walked in the garden:
The garden had fallen still;
He bade his soul rise upward
And stand on her window-sill.

It rose in a straight blue garment,
When owls began to call:
It had grown wise-tongued by thinking
Of a quiet and light footfall;

But the young queen would not listen;
She rose in her pale night-gown;
She drew in the heavy casement
And pushed the latches down.

He bade his heart go to her,
When the owls called out no more;
In a red and quivering garment
It sang to her through the door.

It had grown sweet-tongued by dreaming
Of a flutter of flower-like hair;
But she took up her fan from the table
And waved it off on the air.

'I have cap and bells, he pondered,
'I will send them to her and die;
And when the morning whitened
He left them where she went by.

She laid them upon her bosom,
Under a cloud of her hair,
And her red lips sang them a love-song
Till stars grew out of the air.

She opened her door and her window,
And the heart and the soul came through,
To her right hand came the red one,
To her left hand came the blue.

They set up a noise like crickets,
A chattering wise and sweet,
And her hair was a folded flower
And the quiet of love in her feet."
"What large, dark hands are those at the window
Lifted, grasping the golden light
Which weaves its way through the creeper leaves
       To my heart's delight?

Ah, only the leaves! But in the west,
In the west I see a redness come
Over the evening's burning breast 
        'Tis the wound of love goes home!

The woodbine creeps abroad
Calling low to her lover:
The sun-lit flirt who all the day
Has poised above her lips in play
And stolen kisses, shallow and gay
Of pollen, now has gone away
 She woos the moth with her sweet, low word,
And when above her his broad wings hover
Then her bright breast she will uncover
And yield her honey-drop to her lover.

Into the yellow, evening glow
Saunters a man from the farm below,
Leans, and looks in at the low-built shed
Where hangs the swallow's marriage bed.
The bird lies warm against the wall.
She glances quick her startled eyes
Towards him, then she turns away
Her small head, making warm display
Of red upon the throat. His terrors sway
Her out of the nest's warm, busy ball,
Whose plaintive cry is heard as she flies
In one blue stoop from out the sties
Into the evening's empty hall.

Oh, water-hen, beside the rushes
Hide your quaint, unfading blushes,
Still your quick tail, and lie as dead,
Till the distance folds over his ominous tread.

The rabbit presses back her ears,
Turns back her liquid, anguished eyes
And crouches low: then with wild spring
Spurts from the terror of his oncoming
To be choked back, the wire ring
Her frantic effort throttling:
Piteous brown ball of quivering fears!

Ah soon in his large, hard hands she dies,
And swings all loose to the swing of his walk.
Yet calm and kindly are his eyes
And ready to open in brown surprise
Should I not answer to his talk
Or should he my tears surmise.

I hear his hand on the latch, and rise from my chair
Watching the door open: he flashes bare
His strong teeth in a smile, and flashes his eyes
In a smile like triumph upon me; then careless-wise
He flings the rabbit soft on the table board
And comes towards me: ah, the uplifted sword
Of his hand against my bosom, and oh, the broad
Blade of his hand that raises my face to applaud
His coming: he raises up my face to him
And caresses my mouth with his fingers, which still smell grim
Of the rabbit's fur! God, I am caught in a snare!
I know not what fine wire is round my throat,
I only know I let him finger there
My pulse of life, letting him nose like a stoat
Who sniffs with joy before he drinks the blood:
And down his mouth comes to my mouth, and down
His dark bright eyes descend like a fiery hood
Upon my mind: his mouth meets mine, and a flood
Of sweet fire sweeps across me, so I drown
Within him, die, and find death good."
"Supper comes at five o'clock,
At six, the evening star,
My lover comes at eight o'clock
But eight o'clock is far.

How could I bear my pain all day
Unless I watched to see
The clock-hands laboring to bring
Eight o'clock to me."
"Go, dumb-born book,
Tell her that sang me once that song of Lawes:
Hadst thou but song
As thou hast subjects known,
Then were there cause in thee that should condone
Even my faults that heavy upon me lie
And build her glories their longevity.

Tell her that sheds
Such treasure in the air,
Recking naught else but that her graces give
Life to the moment,
I would bid them live
As roses might, in magic amber laid,
Red overwrought with orange and all made
One substance and one colour
Braving time.

Tell her that goes
With song upon her lips
But sings not out the song, nor knows
The maker of it, some other mouth,
May be as fair as hers,
Might, in new ages, gain her worshippers,
When our two dusts with Wallers shall be laid,
Siftings on siftings in oblivion,
Till change hath broken down
All things save Beauty alone."
"They came to tell your faults to me,
They named them over one by one;
I laughed aloud when they were done,
I knew them all so well before, 
Oh, they were blind, too blind to see
Your faults had made me love you more."
"I never knew the earth had so much gold
The fields run over with it, and this hill
Hoary and old,
Is young with buoyant blooms that flame and thrill.

Such golden fires, such yellowlo, how good
This spendthrift world, and what a lavish God!
This fringe of wood,
Blazing with buttercup and goldenrod.

You too, beloved, are changed. Again I see
Your face grow mystical, as on that night
You turned to me,
And all the trembling worldand youwere white.

Aye, you are touched; your singing lips grow dumb;
The fields absorb you, color you entire . . .
And you become
A goddess standing in a world of fire!"
"When she rises in the morning
I linger to watch her;
She spreads the bath-cloth underneath the window
And the sunbeams catch her
Glistening white on the shoulders,
While down her sides the mellow
Golden shadow glows as
She stoops to the sponge, and her swung breasts
Sway like full-blown yellow
Gloire de Dijon roses.

She drips herself with water, and her shoulders
Glisten as silver, they crumple up
Like wet and falling roses, and I listen
For the sluicing of their rain-dishevelled petals.
In the window full of sunlight
Concentrates her golden shadow
Fold on fold, until it glows as
Mellow as the glory roses."

"Version 1 (1921)
Yours is the shame and sorrow,
But the disgrace is mine;
Your love was dark and thorough,
Mine was the love of the sun for a flower
He creates with his shine.

I was diligent to explore you,
Blossom you stalk by stalk,
Till my fire of creation bore you
Shrivelling down in the final dour
Anguish  then I suffered a balk.

I knew your pain, and it broke
My fine, craftsman's nerve;
Your body quailed at my stroke,
And my courage failed to give you the last
Fine torture you did deserve.

You are shapely, you are adorned,
But opaque and dull in the flesh,
Who, had I but pierced with the thorned
Fire-threshing anguish, were fused and cast
In a lovely illumined mesh.

Like a painted window: the best
Suffering burnt through your flesh,
Undrossed it and left it blest
With a quivering sweet wisdom of grace: but now
Who shall take you afresh?

Now who will burn you free
From your body's terrors and dross,
Since the fire has failed in me?
What man will stoop in your flesh to plough
The shrieking cross?

A mute, nearly beautiful thing
Is your face, that fills me with shame
As I see it hardening,
Warping the perfect image of God,
And darkening my eternal fame.

Version 2 (1928)
Yours is the sullen sorrow,
The disgrace is also mine;
Your love was intense and thorough,
Mine was the love of a growing flower
For the sunshine.

You had the power to explore me,
Blossom me stalk by stalk;
You woke my spirit, you bore me
To consciousness, you gave me the dour
Awareness  then I suffered a balk.

Body to body I could not
Love you, although I would.
We kissed, we kissed though we should not.
You yielded, we threw the last cast,
And it was no good.

You only endured, and it broke
My craftsman's nerve.
No flesh responded to my stroke;
So I failed to give you the last
Fine torture you did deserve.

You are shapely, you are adorned
But opaque and null in the flesh;
Who, had I but pierced with the thorned
Full anguish, perhaps had been cast
In a lovely illuinined mesh

Like a painted window; the best
Fire passed through your flesh,
Undrossed it, and left it blest
In clean new awareness. But now
Who shall take you afresh?

Now who will burn you free
From your body's deadness and dross?
Since the fire has failed in me,
What man will stoop in your flesh to plough
The shrieking cross?

A mute, nearly beautiful thing
Is your face, that fills me with shame
As I see it hardening;
I should have been cruel enough to bring
You through the flame."
"Strephon kissed me in the spring,
Robin in the fall,
But Colin only looked at me
And never kissed at all.

Strephon's kiss was lost in jest,
Robin's lost in play,
But the kiss in Colin's eyes
Haunts me night and day."
"Let us go then, you and I,
When the evening is spread out against the sky
Like a patient etherized upon a table;
Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,
The muttering retreats
Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels
And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:
Streets that follow like a tedious argument
Of insidious intent
To lead you to an overwhelming question ...
Oh, do not ask, What is it?
Let us go and make our visit.

In the room the women come and go
Talking of Michelangelo.

The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,
The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes,
Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,
Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,
Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,
Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,
And seeing that it was a soft October night,
Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.

And indeed there will be time
For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,
Rubbing its back upon the window-panes;
There will be time, there will be time
To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;
There will be time to murder and create,
And time for all the works and days of hands
That lift and drop a question on your plate;
Time for you and time for me,
And time yet for a hundred indecisions,
And for a hundred visions and revisions,
Before the taking of a toast and tea.

In the room the women come and go
Talking of Michelangelo.

And indeed there will be time
To wonder, Do I dare? and, Do I dare?
Time to turn back and descend the stair,
With a bald spot in the middle of my hair 
(They will say: How his hair is growing thin!)
My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,
My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin 
(They will say: But how his arms and legs are thin!)
Do I dare
Disturb the universe?
In a minute there is time
For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.

For I have known them all already, known them all:
Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,
I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;
I know the voices dying with a dying fall
Beneath the music from a farther room.
               So how should I presume?

And I have known the eyes already, known them all
The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,
And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,
When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,
Then how should I begin
To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?
               And how should I presume?

And I have known the arms already, known them all
Arms that are braceleted and white and bare
(But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!)
Is it perfume from a dress
That makes me so digress?
Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.
               And should I then presume?
               And how should I begin?

Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets
And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes
Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows? ...

I should have been a pair of ragged claws
Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.

And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!
Smoothed by long fingers,
Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers,
Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me.
Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,
Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?
But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,
Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,
I am no prophet  and heres no great matter;
I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,
And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,
And in short, I was afraid.

And would it have been worth it, after all,
After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,
Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,
Would it have been worth while,
To have bitten off the matter with a smile,
To have squeezed the universe into a ball
To roll it towards some overwhelming question,
To say: I am Lazarus, come from the dead,
Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all
If one, settling a pillow by her head
               Should say: That is not what I meant at all;
               That is not it, at all.

And would it have been worth it, after all,
Would it have been worth while,
After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,
After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor
And this, and so much more?
It is impossible to say just what I mean!
But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:
Would it have been worth while
If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,
And turning toward the window, should say:
               That is not it at all,
               That is not what I meant, at all.

No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;
Am an attendant lord, one that will do
To swell a progress, start a scene or two,
Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,
Deferential, glad to be of use,
Politic, cautious, and meticulous;
Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;
At times, indeed, almost ridiculous
Almost, at times, the Fool.

I grow old ... I grow old ...
I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.

Shall I part my hair behind?   Do I dare to eat a peach?
I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.
I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.

I do not think that they will sing to me.

I have seen them riding seaward on the waves
Combing the white hair of the waves blown back
When the wind blows the water white and black.
We have lingered in the chambers of the sea
By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown
Till human voices wake us, and we drown."
"I went to the dances at Chandlerville,
And played snap-out at Winchester.
One time we changed partners,
Driving home in the moonlight of middle June,
And then I found Davis.
We were married and lived together for seventy years,
Enjoying, working, raising the twelve children,
Eight of whom we lost
Ere I had reached the age of sixty.
I spun, I wove, I kept the house, I nursed the sick,
I made the garden, and for holiday
Rambled over the fields where sang the larks,
And by Spoon River gathering many a shell,
And many a flower and medicinal weed 
Shouting to the wooded hills, singing to the green valleys.
At ninety-six I had lived enough, that is all,
And passed to a sweet repose.
What is this I hear of sorrow and weariness,
Anger, discontent and drooping hopes?
Degenerate sons and daughters,
Life is too strong for you 
It takes life to love Life."
"Seen my lady home las' night,
Jump back, honey, jump back.
Hel' huh han' an' sque'z it tight,
Jump back, honey, jump back.
Hyeahd huh sigh a little sigh,
Seen a light gleam f'om huh eye,

Jump back, honey, jump back."
"W'en daih's chillun in de house,

'Twell dey fin' out some fine day

"I saw her in a Broadway car,
The woman I might grow to be;
I felt my lover look at her
And then turn suddenly to me.

Her hair was dull and drew no light
And yet its color was as mine;
Her eyes were strangely like my eyes
Tho' love had never made them shine.

Her body was a thing grown thin,
Hungry for love that never came;
Her soul was frozen in the dark
Unwarmed forever by love's flame.

I felt my lover look at her
And then turn suddenly to me, 
His eyes were magic to defy
The woman I shall never be."
"                                          I
Just as my fingers on these keys
Make music, so the selfsame sounds
On my spirit make a music, too.

Music is feeling, then, not sound;
And thus it is that what I feel,
Here in this room, desiring you,

Thinking of your blue-shadowed silk,
Is music. It is like the strain
Waked in the elders by Susanna: 

Of a green evening, clear and warm,
She bathed in her still garden, while
The red-eyed elders, watching, felt

The basses of their beings throb
In witching chords, and their thin blood
Pulse pizzicati of Hosanna.


                                              II
In the green water, clear and warm,
Susanna lay.
She searched
The touch of springs,
And found
Concealed imaginings.
She sighed,
For so much melody.

Upon the bank, she stood
In the cool
Of spent emotions.
She felt, among the leaves,
The dew
Of old devotions.

She walked upon the grass,
Still quavering.
The winds were like her maids,
On timid feet,
Fetching her woven scarves,
Yet wavering.

A breath upon her hand
Muted the night.
She turned
A cymbal crashed,
And roaring horns.


                                           III
Soon, with a noise like tambourines,
Came her attendant Byzantines.

They wondered why Susanna cried
Against the elders by her side;

And as they whispered, the refrain
Was like a willow swept by rain.

Anon, their lamps' uplifted flame
Revealed Susanna and her shame.

And then, the simpering Byzantines
Fled, with a noise like tambourines.


                                             IV
Beauty is momentary in the mind
The fitful tracing of a portal;
But in the flesh it is immortal.

The body dies; the body's beauty lives.
So evenings die, in their green going,
A wave, interminably flowing.
So gardens die, their meek breath scenting
The cowl of winter, done repenting.
So maidens die, to the auroral
Celebration of a maiden's choral.

Susanna's music touched the bawdy strings
Of those white elders; but, escaping,
Left only Death's ironic scraping.
Now, in its immortality, it plays
On the clear viol of her memory,
And makes a constant sacrament of praise."
"I
Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
You have the scene arrange itself  as it will seem to do
With ""I have saved this afternoon for you"";
And four wax candles in the darkened room,
Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
""So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
Should be resurrected only among friends
Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room.""
And so the conversation slips
Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
Through attenuated tones of violins
Mingled with remote cornets
And begins.

""You do not know how much they mean to me, my friends,
And how, how rare and strange it is, to find
In a life composed so much, so much of odds and ends,
(For indeed I do not love it ... you knew? you are not blind!
How keen you are!)
To find a friend who has these qualities,
Who has, and gives
Those qualities upon which friendship lives.
How much it means that I say this to you 
Without these friendships  life, what cauchemar!""
Among the winding of the violins
And the ariettes
Of cracked cornets
Inside my brain a dull tom-tom begins
Absurdly hammering a prelude of its own,
Capricious monotone
That is at least one definite ""false note.""
 Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance,
Admire the monuments,
Discuss the late events,
Correct our watches by the public clocks.
Then sit for half an hour and drink our bocks.

II
Now that lilacs are in bloom
She has a bowl of lilacs in her room
And twists one in her fingers while she talks.
""Ah, my friend, you do not know, you do not know
What life is, you who hold it in your hands"";
(Slowly twisting the lilac stalks)
""You let it flow from you, you let it flow,
And youth is cruel, and has no remorse
And smiles at situations which it cannot see.""
I smile, of course,
And go on drinking tea.
""Yet with these April sunsets, that somehow recall
My buried life, and Paris in the Spring,
I feel immeasurably at peace, and find the world
To be wonderful and youthful, after all.""

The voice returns like the insistent out-of-tune
Of a broken violin on an August afternoon:
""I am always sure that you understand
My feelings, always sure that you feel,
Sure that across the gulf you reach your hand.

You are invulnerable, you have no Achilles' heel.
You will go on, and when you have prevailed
You can say: at this point many a one has failed.

But what have I, but what have I, my friend,
To give you, what can you receive from me?
Only the friendship and the sympathy
Of one about to reach her journey's end.

I shall sit here, serving tea to friends ....""

I take my hat: how can I make a cowardly amends
For what she has said to me?
You will see me any morning in the park
Reading the comics and the sporting page.
Particularly I remark.
An English countess goes upon the stage.
A Greek was murdered at a Polish dance,
Another bank defaulter has confessed.
I keep my countenance,
I remain self-possessed
Except when a street-piano, mechanical and tired
Reiterates some worn-out common song
With the smell of hyacinths across the garden
Recalling things that other people have desired.
Are these ideas right or wrong?

III
The October night comes down; returning as before
Except for a slight sensation of being ill at ease
I mount the stairs and turn the handle of the door
And feel as if I had mounted on my hands and knees.
""And so you are going abroad; and when do you return?
But that's a useless question.
You hardly know when you are coming back,
You will find so much to learn.""
My smile falls heavily among the bric-a-brac.

""Perhaps you can write to me.""
My self-possession flares up for a second;
This is as I had reckoned.
""I have been wondering frequently of late
(But our beginnings never know our ends!)
Why we have not developed into friends.""
I feel like one who smiles, and turning shall remark
Suddenly, his expression in a glass.
My self-possession gutters; we are really in the dark.

""For everybody said so, all our friends,
They all were sure our feelings would relate
So closely! I myself can hardly understand.
We must leave it now to fate.
You will write, at any rate.
Perhaps it is not too late.
I shall sit here, serving tea to friends.""
And I must borrow every changing shape
To find expression ... dance, dance
Like a dancing bear,
Cry like a parrot, chatter like an ape.
Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance
Well! and what if she should die some afternoon,
Afternoon grey and smoky, evening yellow and rose;
Should die and leave me sitting pen in hand
With the smoke coming down above the housetops;
Doubtful, for quite a while
Not knowing what to feel or if I understand
Or whether wise or foolish, tardy or too soon ...
Would she not have the advantage, after all?
This music is successful with a ""dying fall""
Now that we talk of dying
And should I have the right to smile?"
"Maurice, weep not, I am not here under this pine tree.
The balmy air of spring whispers through the sweet grass,
The stars sparkle, the whippoorwill calls,
But thou grievest, while my soul lies rapturous
In the blest Nirvana of eternal light!
Go to the good heart that is my husband,
Who broods upon what he calls our guilty love: i
Tell him that my love for you, no less than my love for him
Wrought out my destiny i that through the flesh
I won spirit, and through spirit, peace.
There is no marriage in heaven,
But there is love."
"I shall not go with pain
Whether you hold me, whether you forget
My little loss and my immortal gain.
O flower unseen, O fountain sealed apart!
Give me one look, one look remembering yet,
Sweet heart.

I shall not go with grief,
Whether you call me, whether you deny
The crowning vintage and the golden sheaf.
O, April hopes that blossom but to close!
Give me one look, one look and so good-bye,
Red rose.

I shall not go with sighs,
But as full-crowned the warrior leaves the fight,
Dawn on his shield and death upon his eyes.
O, life so bitter-sweet and heaven so far!
Give me one look, one look and so good night,
My star."
"Wintah, summah, snow er shine,
Hit's all de same to me,
Ef only I kin call you mine,
An' keep you by my knee.

Ha'dship, frolic, grief er caih,
Content by night an' day,
Ef only I kin see you whaih
You wait beside de way.

Livin', dyin', smiles er teahs,
My soul will still be free,
Ef only thoo de comin' yeahs
You walk de worl' wid me.

Bird-song, breeze-wail, chune er moan,
What puny t'ings dey'll be,
Ef w'en I's seemin' all erlone,
I knows yo' hea't's wid me."
"This youth too long has heard the break
Of waters in a land of change.
He goes to see what suns can make
From soil more indurate and strange.

He cuts what holds his days together
And shuts him in, as lock on lock:
The arrowed vane announcing weather,
The tripping racket of a clock;

Seeking, I think, a light that waits
Still as a lamp upon a shelf, 
A land with hills like rocky gates
Where no sea leaps upon itself.

But he will find that nothing dares
To be enduring, save where, south
Of hidden deserts, torn fire glares
On beauty with a rusted mouth, 

Where something dreadful and another
Look quietly upon each other."
"Making his advances
He does not look at her, nor sniff at her,
No, not even sniff at her, his nose is blank.

Only he senses the vulnerable folds of skin
That work beneath her while she sprawls along
In her ungainly pace,
Her folds of skin that work and row
Beneath the earth-soiled hovel in which she moves.

And so he strains beneath her housey walls
And catches her trouser-legs in his beak
Suddenly, or her skinny limb,
And strange and grimly drags at her
Like a dog,
Only agelessly silent, with a reptile's awful persistency.

Grim, gruesome gallantry, to which he is doomed.
Dragged out of an eternity of silent isolation
And doomed to partiality, partial being,
Ache, and want of being,
Want,
Self-exposure, hard humiliation, need to add himself on to her.

Born to walk alone,
Forerunner,
Now suddenly distracted into this mazy side-track,
This awkward, harrowing pursuit,
This grim necessity from within.

Does she know
As she moves eternally slowly away?
Or is he driven against her with a bang, like a bird flying in the dark against a window,
All knowledgeless?

The awful concussion,
And the still more awful need to persist, to follow, follow, continue,
Driven, after ons of pristine, fore-god-like singleness and oneness,
At the end of some mysterious, red-hot iron,
Driven away from himself into her tracks,
Forced to crash against her.

Stiff, gallant, irascible, crook-legged reptile,
Little gentleman,
Sorry plight,
We ought to look the other way.

Save that, having come with you so far,
We will go on to the end."
"I thought he was dumb,
I said he was dumb,
Yet I've heard him cry.

First faint scream,
Out of life's unfathomable dawn,
Far off, so far, like a madness, under the horizon's dawning rim,
Far, far off, far scream.

Tortoise in extremis.

Why were we crucified into sex?
Why were we not left rounded off, and finished in ourselves,
As we began,
As he certainly began, so perfectly alone?

A far, was-it-audible scream,
Or did it sound on the plasm direct?

Worse than the cry of the new-born,
A scream,
A yell,
A shout,
A pan,
A death-agony,
A birth-cry,
A submission,
All tiny, tiny, far away, reptile under the first dawn.

War-cry, triumph, acute-delight, death-scream reptilian,
Why was the veil torn?
The silken shriek of the soul's torn membrane?
The male soul's membrane
Torn with a shriek half music, half horror.

Crucifixion.
Male tortoise, cleaving behind the hovel-wall of that dense female,
Mounted and tense, spread-eagle, out-reaching out of the shell
In tortoise-nakedness,
Long neck, and long vulnerable limbs extruded, spread-eagle over her house-roof,
And the deep, secret, all-penetrating tail curved beneath her walls,
Reaching and gripping tense, more reaching anguish in uttermost tension
Till suddenly, in the spasm of coition, tupping like a jerking leap, and oh!
Opening its clenched face from his outstretched neck
And giving that fragile yell, that scream,
Super-audible,
From his pink, cleft, old-man's mouth,
Giving up the ghost,
Or screaming in Pentecost, receiving the ghost.

His scream, and his moment's subsidence,
The moment of eternal silence,
Yet unreleased, and after the moment, the sudden, startling jerk of coition, and at once
The inexpressible faint yell 
And so on, till the last plasm of my body was melted back
To the primeval rudiments of life, and the secret.

So he tups, and screams
Time after time that frail, torn scream
After each jerk, the longish interval,
The tortoise eternity,
Agelong, reptilian persistence,
Heart-throb, slow heart-throb, persistent for the next spasm.

I remember, when I was a boy,
I heard the scream of a frog, which was caught with his foot in the mouth of an up-starting snake;
I remember when I first heard bull-frogs break into sound in the spring;
I remember hearing a wild goose out of the throat of night
Cry loudly, beyond the lake of waters;
I remember the first time, out of a bush in the darkness, a nightingale's piercing cries and gurgles startled the depths of my soul;
I remember the scream of a rabbit as I went through a wood at midnight;
I remember the heifer in her heat, blorting and blorting through the hours, persistent and irrepressible;
I remember my first terror hearing the howl of weird, amorous cats;
I remember the scream of a terrified, injured horse, the sheet-lightning
And running away from the sound of a woman in labor, something like an owl whooing,
And listening inwardly to the first bleat of a lamb,
The first wail of an infant,
And my mother singing to herself,
And the first tenor singing of the passionate throat of a young collier, who has long since drunk himself to death,
The first elements of foreign speech
On wild dark lips.

And more than all these,
And less than all these,
This last,
Strange, faint coition yell
Of the male tortoise at extremity,
Tiny from under the very edge of the farthest far-off horizon of life.

The cross,
The wheel on which our silence first is broken,
Sex, which breaks up our integrity, our single inviolability, our deep silence
Tearing a cry from us.

Sex, which breaks us into voice, sets us calling across the deeps, calling, calling for the complement,
Singing, and calling, and singing again, being answered, having found.

Torn, to become whole again, after long seeking for what is lost,
The same cry from the tortoise as from Christ, the Osiris-cry of abandonment,
That which is whole, torn asunder,
That which is in part, finding its whole again throughout the universe."
"With the man I love who loves me not,
I walked in the street-lamps' flare;
We watched the world go home that night
In a flood through Union Square.

I leaned to catch the words he said
That were light as a snowflake falling;
Ah well that he never leaned to hear
The words my heart was calling.

And on we walked and on we walked
Past the fiery lights of the picture shows 
Where the girls with thirsty eyes go by
On the errand each man knows.

And on we walked and on we walked,
At the door at last we said good-bye;
I knew by his smile he had not heard
My heart's unuttered cry.

With the man I love who loves me not
I walked in the street-lamps' flare 
But oh, the girls who ask for love
In the lights of Union Square."

"When you are old and grey and full of sleep,
And nodding by the fire, take down this book,
And slowly read, and dream of the soft look
Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;

How many loved your moments of glad grace,
And loved your beauty with love false or true,
But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,
And loved the sorrows of your changing face;

And bending down beside the glowing bars,
Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled
And paced upon the mountains overhead
And hid his face amid a crowd of stars."
"Give me hunger,
O you gods that sit and give
The world its orders.
Give me hunger, pain and want,
Shut me out with shame and failure
From your doors of gold and fame,
Give me your shabbiest, weariest hunger!

But leave me a little love,
A voice to speak to me in the day end,
A hand to touch me in the dark room
Breaking the long loneliness.
In the dusk of day-shapes
Blurring the sunset,
One little wandering, western star
Thrust out from the changing shores of shadow.
Let me go to the window,
Watch there the day-shapes of dusk
And wait and know the coming
Of a little love."
"Potuia, potuia
White grave goddess,
Pity my sadness,
O silence of Paros.

I am not of these about thy feet,
These garments and decorum;
I am thy brother,
Thy lover of aforetime crying to thee,
And thou hearest me not.

I have whispered thee in thy solitudes
Of our loves in Phrygia,
The far ecstasy of burning noons
When the fragile pipes
Ceased in the cypress shade,
And the brown fingers of the shepherd
Moved over slim shoulders;
And only the cicada sang.

I have told thee of the hills
And the lisp of reeds
And the sun upon thy breasts,

And thou hearest me not,
Potuia, potuia
Thou hearest me not."
O the splendour of our joy, woven of gold in thesilken air!
Here is our pleasant house and its airy gables,and the garden and the orchard.
Here is the bench beneath the apple-trees, whencethe white spring is shed in slow, caressingpetals.
Here flights of luminous wood-pigeons, likeharbingers, soar in the clear sky of thecountryside.
Here, kisses fallen upon earth from the mouth ofthe frail azure, are two blue ponds, simple andpure, artlessly bordered with involuntary flowers.
O the splendour of our joy and of ourselves inthis garden where we live upon our emblems.
Although we saw this bright garden, wherein wepass silently, flower before our eyes, it israther in us that grows the pleasantest andfairest garden in the world.
For we live all the flowers, all the plants andall the grasses in our laughter and our tears ofpure and calm happiness.
For we live all the transparencies of the bluepond that reflects the rich growths of the goldenroses and the great vermilion lilies, sun-lipsand mouths.
For we live all joy, thrown out in the criesof festival and spring of our avowals, whereinheartfelt and uplifting words sing side by side.
Oh! is it not indeed in us that grows thepleasantest and the gladdest garden in the world?
This barbaric capital, whereon monsters writhe,soldered together by the might of claw and tooth,in a mad whirl of blood, of fiery cries, ofwounds, and of jaws that bite and bite again,
This was myself before you were mine, you who arenew and old, and who, from the depths of youreternity, came to me with passion and kindness inyour hands.
I feel the same deep, deep things sleeping in youas in me, and our thirst for remembrance drink upthe echo in which our pasts answer each to each.
Our eyes must have wept at the same hours,without our knowing, during childhood, have hadthe same terrors, the same happinesses, the sameflashes of trust;
For I am bound to you by the unknown that watchedme of old down the avenues through which myadventurous life passed; and, indeed, if I hadlooked more closely, I might have seen, long ago,within its eyes your own eyes open.
The sky has unfolded into night, and the moonseems to watch over the sleeping silence.
All is so pure and clear; all is so pure and sopale in the air and on the lakes of the friendlycountryside, that there is anguish in the fallfrom a reed of a drop of water, that tinkles andthen is silent in the water.
But I have your hands between mine and yoursteadfast eyes that hold me so gently with theirearnestness; and I feel that you are so much atpeace with everything that nothing, not even afleeting suspicion of fear, will overcast, be itbut for a moment, the holy trust that sleeps inus as an infant rests.
Each hour I brood upon your goodness, so simplein its depth, I lose myself in prayers to you.
I came so late towards the gentleness of youreyes, and from so far towards your two handsstretched out quietly over the wide spaces.
I had in me so much stubborn rust that gnawed myconfidence with its ravenous teeth.
I was so heavy, was so tired, I was so old withmisgiving.
I was so heavy, I was so tired of the vain roadof all my footsteps.
I deserved so little the wondrous joy of seeingyour feet illuminate my path that I am stilltrembling and almost in tears, and humble, forever and ever, before my happiness.
Sometimes you wear the kindly grace of the gardenin early morning that, quiet and winding, unfoldsin the blue distances its pleasant paths, curvedlike the necks of swans.
And, at other times, you are for me the brightthrill of the swift, exalting wind that passeswith its lightning fingers through the waterymane of the white pond.
At the good touch of your two hands, I feel asthough leaves were caressing me lightly; and,when midday burns the garden, the shadows at oncegather up the dear words with which your beingtrembled.
Thus, thanks to you, each moment seems to pass inme divinely; so, at the hour of wan night, whenyou hide within yourself, shutting your eyes, youfeel my gentle, devout gaze, humbler and longerthan a prayer, thank yours beneath your closedeyelids.
Oh! let the passing hand knock with its futilefingers on the door; our hour is so unique, andthe rest--what matters the rest with its futilefingers?
Let dismal, tiresome joy keep to the road andpass on with its rattles in its hand.
Let laughter swell and clatter and die away; letthe crowd pass with its thousands of voices.
The moment is so lovely with light in the gardenabout us; the moment is so rare with virgin lightin our heart deep down in us.
Everything tells us to expect nothing more fromthat which comes or passes, with tired songs andweary arms, on the roads,
And to remain the meek who bless the day, evenwhen night is before us barricaded with darkness,loving in ourselves above all else the idea that,gently, we conceive of our love.
As in the simple ages, I have given you my heart,like a wide-spreading flower that opens pure andlovely in the dewy hours; within its moist petalsmy lips have rested.
The flower, I gathered it with fingers of flame;say nothing to it: for all words are perilous; itis through the eyes that soul listens to soul.
The flower that is my heart and my avowalconfides in all simplicity to your lips that itis loyal, bright and good, and that we trust invirgin love as a child trusts in God.
Leave wit to flower on the hills in freakishpaths of vanity; and let us give a simple welcometo the sincerity that holds our two true heartswithin its crystalline hands;
Nothing is so lovely as a confession of soulsone to the other, in the evening, when the flameof the uncountable diamonds burns like so manysilent eyes the silence of the firmaments.
Young and kindly spring who clothes our gardenwith beauty makes lucid our voices and words, andsteeps them in his limpidity.
The breeze and the lips of the leaves babble,and slowly shed in us the syllables of theirbrightness.
But the best in us turns away and flees materialwords; a mute and mild and simple rapture, betterthan all speech, moors our happiness to its trueheaven:
The rapture of your soul, kneeling in allsimplicity before mine, and of my soul, kneelingin gentleness before yours.
Come with slow steps and sit near the gardenbed,whose flowers of tranquil light are shut byevening; let the great night filter through you:we are too happy for our prayer to be disturbedby its sea of dread.
Above, the pure crystal of the stars is lit up;behold the firmament clearer and more translucentthan a blue pond or the stained-glass windowin an apse; and then behold heaven that gazesthrough.
The thousand voices of the vast mystery speakaround you; the thousand laws of all nature arein movement about you; the silver bows of theinvisible take your soul and its fervour fortarget,
But you are not afraid, oh! simple heart, youare not afraid, since your faith is that thewhole earth works in harmony with that love thatbrought forth in you life and its mystery.
Clasp then your hands tranquilly, and adoregently; a great counsel of purity floats likea strange dawn beneath the midnights of thefirmament.
How readily delight is aroused in her, with hereyes of fiery ecstasy, she who is gentle andresigned before life in so simple a fashion.
This evening, how a look surprised her fervourand a word transported her to the pure garden ofgladness, where she was at once both queen andservant.
Humble of herself, but aglow with our two selves,she vied with me in kneeling to gather thewondrous happiness that overflowed mutually fromour hearts.
We listened to the dying down in us of theviolence of the exalting love imprisoned in ourarms, and to the living silence that said wordswe did not know.
At the time when I had long suffered and thehours were snares to me, you appeared to me asthe welcoming light that shines from the windowson to the snow in the depths of winter evenings.
The brightness of your hospitable soul touched myheart lightly without wounding it, like a hand oftranquil warmth.
Then came a holy trust, and an open heart, andaffection, and the union at last of our twoloving hands, one evening of clear understandingand of gentle calm.
Since then, although summer has followed frostboth in ourselves and beneath the sky whoseeternal flames deck with gold all the paths ofour thoughts;
And although our love has become an immenseflower, springing from proud desire, that everbegins anew within our heart, to grow yet better;
I still look back on the small light that wassweet to me, the first.
And what matters the wherefores and the reasons,and who we were and who we are; all doubt is deadin this garden of blossoms that opens up in usand about us, so far from men.
I do not argue, and do not desire to know, andnothing will disturb what is but mystery andgentle raptures and involuntary fervour andtranquil soaring towards our heaven of hope.
I feel your brightness before understanding thatyou are so; and it is my gladness, infinitely, toperceive myself thus gently loving without askingwhy your voice calls me.
Let us be simple and good--and day be minister oflight and affection to us; and let them say thatlife is not made for a love like ours.
In my dreams, I sometimes pair you with thosequeens who slowly descend the golden, floweredstairways of legend; I give you names that aremarried with beauty, splendour and gladness, andthat rustle in silken syllables along versesbuilt as a platform for the dance of words andtheir stately pageantries.
But how quickly I tire of the game, seeing yougentle and wise, and so little like those whoseattitudes men embellish.
Your brow, so shining and pure and white withcertitude, your gentle, childlike hands peacefulupon your knees, your breasts rising and fallingwith the rhythm of your pulse that beats likeyour immense, ingenuous heart,
Oh! how everything, except that and your prayer,oh! how everything is poor and empty, except thelight that gazes at me and welcomes me in yournaked eyes.
I dedicate to your tears, to your smile, mygentlest thoughts, those I tell you, those alsothat remain undefined and too deep to tell.
I dedicate to your tears, to your smile, to yourwhole soul, my soul, with its tears and itssmiles and its kiss.
See, the dawn whitens the ground that is thecolour of lees of wine; shadowy bonds seem toslip and glide away with melancholy; the waterof the ponds grows bright and sifts its noise;the grass glitters and the flowers open, and thegolden woods free themselves from the night.
Oh! what if we could one day enter thus into thefull light; oh, what if we could one day, withconquering cries and lofty prayers, with no moreveils upon us and no more remorse in us, oh! whatif we could one day enter together into lucidlove.
I drown my entire soul in your two eyes, andthe mad rapture of that frenzied soul, so that,having been steeped in their gentleness andprayer, it may be returned to me brighter and oftruer temper.
O for a union that refines the being, as twogolden windows in the same apse cross theirdifferently lucent fires and interpenetrate!
I am sometimes so heavy, so weary of being onewho cannot be perfect, as he would! My heartstruggles with its desires, my heart whose evilweeds, between the rocks of stubbornness, rearslyly their inky or burning flowers;
My heart, so false, so true, as the day may be,my contradictory heart, my heart ever exaggeratedwith immense joy or with criminal fear.
To love with our eyes, let us lave our gaze ofthe gaze of those whose glances we have crossed,by thousands, in life that is evil and enthralled.
The dawn is of flowers and dew and the mildestsifted light; soft plumes of silver and sun seemthrough the mists to brush and caress the mossesin the garden.
Our blue and marvellous ponds quiver and come tolife with shimmering gold; emerald wings passunder the trees; and the brightness sweeps fromthe roads, the garths and the hedges the dampashen fog in which the twilight still lingers.
In the garden of our love, summer still goeson: yonder, a golden peacock crosses an avenue;petals--pearls, emeralds, turquoises --deck theuniform slumber of the green swards.
Our blue ponds shimmer, covered with thewhite kiss of the snowy water-lilies; in thequincunxes, our currant bushes follow one anotherin procession; an iridescent insect teases theheart of a flower; the marvellous undergrowthsare veined with gleams; and, like light bubbles,a thousand bees quiver along the arbours over thesilver grapes.
The air is so lovely that it seems rainbow-hued;beneath the deep and radiant noons, it stirsas if it were roses of light; while, in thedistance, the customary roads, like slowmovements stretching their vermilion to thepearly horizon, climb towards the sun.
Indeed, the diamonded gown of this finesummer clothes no other garden with so pure abrightness. And the unique joy sprung up inour two hearts discovers its own life in theseclusters of flames.
May your bright eyes, your eyes of summer, be forme here on earth the images of goodness.
Let our enkindled souls clothe with gold eachflame of our thoughts.
May my two hands against your heart be for youhere on earth the emblems of gentleness.
Let us live like two frenzied prayers strainingat all hours one towards the other.
May our kisses on our enraptured mouths be for ushere on earth the symbols of our life.
Tell me, my simple and tranquil sweetheart, tellme how much an absence, even of a day, saddensand stirs up love, and reawakens it in all itssleeping scalds?
I go to meet those who are returning from thewondrous distances to which at dawn you went; Isit beneath a tree at a bend of the path, and, onthe road, watching their coming, I gaze and gazeearnestly at their eyes still bright with havingseen you.
And I would kiss their fingers that have touchedyou, and cry out to them words they would notunderstand; and I listen a long while to therhythm of their steps towards the shadow wherethe old evenings hold night prone.
During those hours wherein we are lost so farfrom all that is not ourselves, what lustralblood or what baptism bathes our hearts thatstrain towards all love?
Clasping our hands without praying, stretchingout our arms without crying aloud, but withearnest and ingenuous mind worshipping somethingfarther off and purer than ourselves, we know notwhat, how we blend with, how we live our livesin, the unknown.
How overwhelmed we are in the presence of thosehours of supreme existence; how the soul desiresheavens in which to seek for new gods.
Oh! the torturing and wondrous joy and the daringhope of being one day, across death itself, theprey of these silent terrors.
Oh! this happiness, sometimes so rare and frailthat it frightens us!
In vain we hush our voices, and make of all yourhair a tent to shelter us; often the anguish inour hearts flows over.
But our love, being like a kneeling angel, begsand supplicates that the future give to othersthan ourselves a like affection and life, so thattheir fate may not be envious of ours.
And, too, on evil days, when the great eveningsextend to heaven the bounds of despair, we askforgiveness of the night that kindles with thegentleness of our heart.
Let us, in our love and ardour, let us live soboldly our finest thoughts that they interweavein harmony with the supreme ecstasy and perfectfervour.
Because in our kindred souls something more holythan we and purer and greater awakens, let usclasp hands to worship it through ourselves.
It matters not that we have only cries or tearsto define it humbly, and that its charm is sorare and powerful that, in the enjoyment of it,our hearts are nigh to failing us.
Even so, let us remain, and for ever, the maddevotees of this almost implacable love, and thekneeling worshippers of the sudden God who reignsin us, so violent and so ardently gentle that hehurts and overwhelms us.
So soon as our lips touch, we feel so much moreluminous together that it would seem as thoughtwo Gods loved and united in us.
We feel our hearts to be so divinely fresh andso renewed by their virgin light that, in theirbrightness, the universe is made manifest to us.
In our eyes, joy is the only ferment of the worldthat ripens and becomes fruitful innumerably onour roads here below; as in clusters spring upamong the silken lakes on which sails travel themyriad blossoms of the stars above.
Order dazzles us as fire embers, everythingbathes us in its light and appears a torch to us:our simple words have a sense so lovely that werepeat them to hear them without end.
We are the sublime conquerors who vanquisheternity without pride and without a thought oftrifling time: and our love seems to us always tohave been.
To prevent the escape of any part of us from ourembrace that is so intense as to be holy, and tolet love shine clear through the body itself, wego down together to the garden of the flesh.
Your breasts are there like offerings and yourtwo hands are stretched out to me; and nothing isof so much worth as the simple provender of wordssaid and heard.
The shadow of the white boughs travels over yourneck and face, and your hair unloosens its bloomin garlands on the swards.
The night is all of blue silver; the night is alovely silent bed--gentle night whose breezes,one by one, will strip the great lilies erect inthe moonlight.
Although autumn this evening along the paths andthe woods' edges lets the leaves fall slowly likegilded hands;
Although autumn this evening with its arms ofwind harvests the petals and their pallor of theearnest rose-trees;
We shall let nothing of our two souls fallsuddenly with these flowers.
But before the flames of the golden hearth ofmemory, we will both crouch and warm our handsand knees.
To guard against the sorrows hidden in thefuture, against time that makes an end of allardour, against our terror and even againstourselves, we will both crouch near the hearththat our memory has lit up in us.
And if autumn involves the woods, the lawns andthe ponds in great banks of shadow and soaringstorms, at least its pain shall not disturb theinner quiet garden where the equal footsteps ofour thoughts walk together in the light.
The gift of the body when the soul is given isbut the accomplishment of two affections drawnheadlong one towards the other.
You are only happy in your body that is so lovelyin its native freshness because in all fervouryou may offer it to me wholly as a total alms.
And I give myself to you knowing nothing exceptthat I am greater by knowing you, who are everbetter and perhaps purer since your gentle bodyoffered its festival to mine.
Love, oh! let it be for us the sole discernmentand the sole reason of our heart, for us whosemost frenzied happiness is to be frenzied in ourtrust.
Was there in us one fondness, one thought, onegladness, one promise that we had not sown beforeour footsteps?
Was there a prayer heard in secret whose handsstretched out gently over our bosom we had notclasped?
Was there one appeal, one purpose, one tranquilor violent desire whose pace we had not quickened?
And each loving the other thus, our hearts wentout as apostles to the gentle, timid and chilledhearts of others;
And by the power of thought invited them tofeel akin to ours, and, with frank ardours, toproclaim love, as a host of flowers loves thesame branch that suspends and bathes it in thesun.
And our soul, as though made greater in thisawakening, began to celebrate all that loves,magnifying love for love's sake, and to cherishdivinely, with a wild desire, the whole worldthat is summed up in us.
The lovely garden blossoming with flames thatseemed to us the double or the mirror of thebright garden we carried in our hearts iscrystallized in frost and gold this evening.
A great white silence has descended and sitsyonder on the marble horizons, towards whichmarch the trees in files, with their blue,immense and regular shadow beside them.
No puff of wind, no breath. Alone, the greatveils of cold spread from plain to plain over thesilver marshes or crossing roads.
The stars appear to live. The hoar-frost shineslike steel through the translucent, frozen air.Bright powdered metals seem to snow down, in theinfinite distances, from the pallor of a coppermoon. Everything sparkles in the stillness.
And it is the divine hour when the mind ishaunted by the thousand glances that are castupon earth by kind and pure and unchangeableeternity towards the hazards of humanwretchedness.
If it should ever happen that, without ourknowledge, we became a pain or torment or despairone to the other;
If it should come about that weariness orhackneyed pleasure unbent in us the golden bow oflofty desire;
If the crystal of pure thought must fall in ourhearts and break;
If, in spite of all, I should feel myselfvanquished because I had not bowed my willsufficiently to the divine immensity of goodness;
Then, oh! then let us embrace like two sublimemadmen who beneath the broken skies cling to thesummits even so--and with one flight and soulablaze grow greater in death.THE HOURS OF AFTERNOON
Step by step, day by day, age has come and placedhis hands upon the bare forehead of our love, andhas looked upon it with his dimmer eyes.
And in the fair garden shrivelled by July, theflowers, the groves and the living leaves havelet fall something of their fervid strength onto the pale pond and the gentle paths. Here andthere, the sun, harsh and envious, marks a hardshadow around his light.
And yet the hollyhocks still persist in theirgrowth towards their final splendour, and theseasons weigh upon our life in vain; more thanever, all the roots of our two hearts plungeunsatiated into happiness, and clutch, and sinkdeeper.
Oh! these hours of afternoon girt with roses thattwine around time, and rest against his benumbedflanks with cheeks aflower and aflame!
And nothing, nothing is better than to feel thus,still happy and serene, after how many years?But if our destiny had been quite different, andwe had both been called upon to suffer--eventhen!--oh! I should have been happy to live anddie, without complaining, in my stubborn love.
Roses of June, you the fairest with your heartstransfixed by the sun; violent and tranquilroses, like a delicate flock of birds settled onthe branches;
Roses of June and July, upright and new, mouthsand kisses that suddenly move or grow still withthe coming and going of the wind, caress ofshadow and gold on the restless garden;
Roses of mute ardour and gentle will, roses ofvoluptuousness in your mossy sheaths, you whospend the days of high summer loving each otherin the brightness;
Fresh, glowing, magnificent roses, all our roses,oh! that, like you, our manifold desires, in ourdear weariness or trembling pleasure, might loveand exalt each other and rest!
If other flowers adorn the house and thesplendour of the countryside, the pure pondsshine still in the grass with the great eyes ofwater of their mobile face.
Who can say from what far-off and unknowndistances so many new birds have come with sun ontheir wings?
In the garden, April has given way to July, andthe blue tints to the great carnation tints;space is warm and the wind frail; a thousandinsects glisten joyously in the air; and summerpasses in her robe of diamonds and sparks.
The darkness is lustral and the dawn iridescent.From the lofty branch whence a bird flies, thedew-drops fall.
A lucid and frail purity adorns a morning sobright that prisms seem to gleam in the air. Aspring babbles; a noise of wings is heard.
Oh! how beautiful are your eyes at that firsthour when our silver ponds shimmer in the lightand reflect the day that is rising. Your foreheadis radiant and your blood beats.
Intense and wholesome life in all its divinestrength enters your bosom so completely, like adriving happiness, that to contain its anguishand its fury, your hands suddenly take mine, andpress them almost fearfully against your heart.
I bring you this evening, as an offering, my joyat having plunged my body into the silk and goldof the frank and joyous wind and the gorgeoussun; my feet are bright with having walked amongthe grasses; my hands sweet with having touchedthe heart of flowers; my eyes shining at havingfelt the tears suddenly well up and spring intothem before the earth in festival and its eternalstrength.
Space has carried me away drunken and ferventand sobbing in its arms of moving brightness;and I have passed I know not where, far away inthe distance, with pent-up cries set free by myfootsteps.
I bring you life and the beauty of the plainsbreathe them on me in a good, frank breath; themarjoram has caressed my fingers, and the air andits light and its perfumes are in my flesh.
Let us both sit down on the old worm-eaten benchnear the path; and let my hand remain a longwhile within your two steadfast hands.
With my hand that remains a long while givenup to the sweet consciousness of being on yourknees, my heart also, my earnest, gentle heart,seems to rest between your two kind hands.
And we share an intense joy and a deep love tofeel that we are so happy together, without oneover-strong word to come trembling to our lips,or one kiss even to go burning towards your brow.
And we would prolong the ardour of this silenceand the stillness of our mute desires, were itnot that suddenly, feeling them quiver, I clasptightly, without willing it, your thinking hands;
Your hands in which my whole happiness is hidden,and which would never, for anything in the world,deal violently with those deep things we live by,although in duty we do not speak of them.
Gently, more gently still, cradle my head in yourarms, my fevered brow and my weary eyes;
Gently, more gently still, kiss my lips, andsay to me those words that are sweeter at eachdawn when your voice repeats them, and you havesurrendered, and I love you still.
The day rises sullen and heavy; the night wascrossed by monstrous dreams; the rain and itslong hair whip our casement, and the horizon isblack with clouds of grief.
Gently, more gently still, cradle my head in yourarms, my fevered brow and my weary eyes; you aremy hopeful dawn, with its caress in your handsand its light in your sweet words;
See, I am re-born, without pain or shock, to thedaily labour that traces its mark on my road,and instils into my life the will to be a weaponof strength and beauty in the golden grasp of anhonoured life.
In the house chosen by our love as itsbirth-place, with its cherished furniturepeopling the shadows and the nooks, where we livetogether, having as sole witnesses the roses thatwatch us through the windows,
Certain days stand out of so great a consolation,certain hours of summer so lovely in theirsilence, that sometimes I stop time that swingswith its golden disc in the oaken clock.
Then the hour, the day, the night is so much oursthat the happiness that hovers lightly over ushears nothing but the throbbing of your heart andmine that are brought close together by a suddenembrace.
The pleasant task with the window open and theshadow of the green leaves and the passage ofthe sun on the ruddy paper, maintains the gentleviolence of its silence in our good and pensivehouse.
And the flowers bend nimbly and the large fruitsshine from branch to branch, and the blackbirds,the bullfinches and the chaffinches sing andsing, so that my verses may burst forth clear andfresh, pure and true, like their songs, theirgolden flesh and their scarlet petals.
And I see you pass in the garden, sometimesmingled with the sun and shadow; but your headdoes not turn, so that the hour in which I workjealousy at these frank and gentle poems may notbe disturbed.
In the depth of our love dwells all faith; webind up a glowing thought together with the leastthings: the awakening of a bud, the decline of arose, the flight of a frail and beautiful birdthat, by turns, appears or disappears in theshadow or the light.
A nest falling to pieces on the mossy edge ofa roof and ravaged by the wind fills the mindwith dread. An insect eating the heart of thehollyhocks terrifies: all is fear, all is hope.
Though reason with its sharp and soothing snowmay suddenly cool these charming pangs, whatmatters! Let us accept them without inquiringovermuch into the false, the true, the evil orthe good they portend;
Let us be happy that we can be as children,believing in their fatal or triumphant power, andlet us guard with closed shutters against toosensible people.
Dawn, darkness, evening, space and the stars;that which the night conceals or shows betweenits veils is mingled with the fervour of ourexalted being. Those who live with love live witheternity.
It matters not that their reason approve orscoff, and, upright on its high walls, hold outto them, along the quays and harbours, its brighttorches; they are the travellers from beyond thesea.
Far off, farther than the ocean and its blackfloods, they watch the day break from shore toshore; fixed certainty and trembling hope presentthe same front to their ardent gaze.
Happy and serene, they believe eagerly; theirsoul is the deep and sudden brightness with whichthey burn the summit of the loftiest problems;and to know the world, they but scrutinizethemselves.
They follow distant roads chosen by themselves,living with the truths enclosed within theirsimple, naked eyes, that are deep and gentle asthe dawn; and for them alone there is still songin paradise.
This is the holy hour when the lamp is lit:everything is calm and comforting this evening;and the silence is such that you could hear thefalling of feathers.
This is the holy hour when gently the belovedcomes, like the breeze or smoke, most gently,most slowly. At first, she says nothing--and Ilisten; and I catch a glimpse of her soul, thatI hear wholly, shining and bursting forth; and Ikiss her on the eyes.
This is the holy hour when the lamp is lit, whenthe acknowledgment of mutual love the whole daylong is brought forth from the depths of our deepbut transparent heart.
And we each tell the other of the simplestthings: the fruit gathered in the garden, theflower that has opened between the green mosses;and the thought that has sprung from somesudden emotion at the memory of a faded word ofaffection found at the bottom of an old drawer ona letter of yesteryear.
The dead kisses of departed years have put theirseal on your face, and, beneath the melancholyand furrowing wind of age, many of the roses inyour features have faded.
I see your mouth and your great eyes glow no morelike a morning of festival, nor your head slowlyrecline in the black and massive garden of yourhair.
Your dear hands, that remain so gentle, approachno more as in former years with light at theirfinger-tips to caress my forehead, as dawn themosses.
Your young and lovely body that I adorned withmy thoughts has no longer the pure freshness ofdew, and your arms are no longer like the brightbranches.
Alas! everything falls and fades ceaselessly;everything has changed, even your voice; yourbody has collapsed like a pavise, and let fallthe victories of youth.
But nevertheless my steadfast and earnest heartsays to you: what are to me the years madeheavier day by day, since I know that nothing inthe world will disturb our exalted life, and thatour soul is too profound for love still to dependon beauty?
For fifteen years our thoughts have run together,and our fine and serene ardour has vanquishedhabit, the dull-voiced shrew whose slow, roughhands wear out the most stubborn and thestrongest love.
I look at you and I discover you each day, sointimate is your gentleness or your pride: timeindeed obscures the eyes of your beauty, but itexalts your heart, whose golden depths peep open.
Artlessly, you allow yourself to be probed andknown, and your soul always appears fresh andnew; with gleaming masts, like an eager caravel,our happiness covers the seas of our desires.
It is in us alone that we anchor our faith, tonaked sincerity and simple goodness; we moveand live in the brightness of a joyous andtranslucent trust.
Your strength is to be infinitely pure and frail;to cross with burning heart all dark roads, andto have preserved, in spite of mist or darkness,all the rays of the dawn in your childlike soul.
I thought our joy benumbed for ever, like asun faded before it was night, on the day thatillness with its leaden arms dragged me heavilytowards its chair of weariness.
The flowers and the garden were fear or deceptionto me; my eyes suffered to see the white noonsflaming, and my two hands, my hands, seemed,before their time, too tired to hold captive ourtrembling happiness.
My desires had become no more than evil weeds;they bit at each other like thistles in the wind;I felt my heart to be at once ice and burningcoal and of a sudden dried up and stubborn inforgiveness.
But you said the word that gently comforts,seeking it nowhere else than in your immenselove; and I lived with the fire of your word, andat night warmed myself at it until the dawn ofday.
The diminished man I felt myself to be, both tomyself and all others, did not exist for you; yougathered flowers for me from the window-sill,and, with your faith, I believed in health.
And you brought to me, in the folds of your gown,the keen air, the wind of the fields and forests,and the perfumes of evening or the scents ofdawn, and, in your fresh and deep-felt kisses,the sun.
Everything that lives about us in the fragile andgentle light, frail grasses, tender branches,hollyhocks, and the shadow that brushes themlightly by, and the wind that knots them, and thesinging and hopping birds that swarm riotouslyin the sun like clusters of jewels,-- everythingthat lives in the fine ruddy garden loves usartlessly, and we--we love everything.
We worship the lilies we see growing; and thetall sunflowers, brighter than the Nadir--circles surrounded by petals of flames--burn oursouls through their glow.
The simplest flowers, the phlox and the lilac,grow along the walls among the feverfew, to benearer to our footsteps; and the involuntaryweeds in the turf over which we have passed opentheir eyes wet with dew.
And we live thus with the flowers and the grass,simple and pure, glowing and exalted, lost in ourlove, like the sheaves in the gold of the corn,and proudly allowing the imperious summer topierce our bodies, our hearts and our two willswith its full brightness.
Because you came one day so simply along thepaths of devotion and took my life into yourbeneficent hands, I love and praise and thank youwith my senses, with my heart and brain, with mywhole being stretched like a torch towards yourunquenchable goodness and charity.
Since that day, I know what love, pure and brightas the dew, falls from you on to my calmed soul.I feel myself yours by all the burning ties thatattach flames to their fire; all my body, all mysoul mounts towards you with tireless ardour; Inever cease to brood on your deep earnestness andyour charm, so much so that suddenly I feel myeyes fill deliciously with unforgettable tears.
And I make towards you, happy and calm, with theproud desire to be for ever the most steadfast ofjoys to you. All our affection flames about us;every echo of my being responds to your call; thehour is unique and sanctified with ecstasy, andmy fingers are tremulous at the mere touching ofyour forehead, as though they brushed the wing ofyour thoughts.
On days of fresh and tranquil health, when lifeis as fine as a conquest, the pleasant task sitsdown by my side like an honoured friend.
He comes from gentle, radiant countries, withwords brighter than the dews, in which to set,illuminating them, our feelings and our thoughts.
He seizes our being in a mad whirlwind; he liftsup the mind on giant pilasters; he pours into itthe fire that makes the stars live; he brings thegift of being God suddenly.
And fevered transports and deep terrors-- allserves his tragic will to make young again theblood of beauty in the veins of the world.
I am at his mercy like a glowing prey.
Therefore, when I return, though wearied andheavy, to the repose of your love, with the firesof my vast and supreme idea, it seems to me--oh!but for a moment--that I am bringing to you inmy panting heart the heart-beat of the universeitself.
Out of the groves of sleep I came, somewhatmorose because I had left you beneath theirbranches and their braided shadows, far from theglad morning sun.
Already the phlox and the hollyhocks glisten, andI wander in the garden dreaming of verses clearas crystal and silver that would ring in thelight.
Then abruptly I return to you with so great afervour and emotion that it seems to me as thoughmy thought suddenly has already crossed from afarthe leafy and heavy darkness of sleep to callforth your joy and your awakening.
And when I join you once more in our warm housethat is still possessed by darkness and silence,my clear, frank kisses ring like a dawn-song inthe valleys of your flesh.
Alas! when the lead of illness flowed in mybenumbed veins with my heavy, sluggish blood,with my blood day by day heavier and moresluggish;
When my eyes, my poor eyes, followed peevishly onmy long, pale hands the fatal marks of insidiousmalady;
When my skin dried up like bark, and I had nolonger even strength enough to press my fierylips against your heart, and there kiss ourhappiness;
When sad and identical days morosely gnawed mylife, I might never have found the will and thestrength to hold out stoically,
Had you not, each hour of the so long weeks,poured into my daily body with your patient,gentle, placid hands the secret heroism thatflowed in yours.
Our bright garden is health itself.
It is squandered in its brightness from thethousand hands of the branches and leaves as theywave to and fro.
And the pleasant shade that welcomes our feetafter the long roads pours into our tired limbsa quickening strength, gentle as the garden'smosses.
When the pond plays with the wind and the sun, aruddy heart seems to dwell in the depths of thewater, and to beat, ardent and young, with theripples; and the tall, straight gladioli and theglowing roses that move in their splendour holdout their golden goblets of red blood at the endof their living stalks.
Our bright garden is health itself.
It was June in the garden, our hour and our day,and our eyes looked upon all things with sogreat a love that the roses seemed to us to opengently, and to see and love us.
The sky was purer than it had ever been: theinsects and birds floated in the gold andgladness of an air as frail as silk, and ourkisses were so exquisite that they gave an addedbeauty to the sunshine and the birds.
It was as though our happiness had suddenlybecome azure, and required the whole sky whereinto shine; through gentle openings, all lifeentered our being, to expand it.
And we were nothing but invocatory cries, andwild raptures, and vows and entreaties, and theneed, suddenly, to recreate the gods, in order tobelieve.
The gift of yourself no longer satisfies you; youare prodigal of yourself: the rapture that bearsyou on to ever greater love springs up in youceaselessly and untiringly, and carries you everhigher towards the wide heaven of perfect love.
A clasp of the hands, a gentle look impassionsyou; and your heart appears to me so suddenlylovely that I am afraid sometimes of your eyesand your lips, and that I am unworthy and thatyou love me too much.
Ah! these bright ardours of an affection toolofty for a poor human being who has only a poorheart, all moist with regrets, all thorny withfaults, to feel their passing and dissolve intears.
Oh! the calm summer garden where nothing moves!Unless it be, near the middle of the bright andradiant pond, the goldfish like tongues of fire.
They are our memories playing in our thoughtsthat are calm and stilled and limpid, like thetrustful and restful water.
And the water brightens and the fishes leap atthe abrupt and marvellous sun, not far from thegreen irises and the white shells and stones,motionless about the ruddy edges.
And it is sweet to watch them thus come and goin the freshness and splendour that touches themlightly, careless and without fear that theywill bring from the depths to the surface otherregrets than fleeting.
As with others, an hour has its ill-humour: thepeevish hour or a malevolent humour has sometimesstamped our hearts with its black seals; and yet,in spite of all, even at the close of the darkestdays, never have our hearts said the irrevocablewords.
A radiant and glowing sincerity was our joy andcounsel, and our passionate soul found thereinever new strength, as in a ruddy flood.
And we recounted each to the other ourwretchedest woes, telling them like some harshrosary, as we stood facing one another, with ourlove rising in sobs; and our two mouths, at eachavowal, gently and in turn kissed our faults onthe lips that uttered them aloud.
Thus, very simply, without baseness or bitterwords, we escaped from the world and fromourselves, sparing ourselves all grief andgnawing cares, and watching the rebirth of oursoul, as the purity of glass and gold of awindow-pane is reborn after the rain, when thesun warms it and gently dries it.
The golden barks of lovely summer that set out,riotous for space, are returning sad and wearyfrom the blood-stained horizons.
With monotonous strokes of the oars, they advanceupon the waters; they are as cradles in whichsleep autumn flowers.
Stalks of lilies with golden brows, you all lieoverthrown; alone, the roses struggle to livebeyond death.
What matters to their full beauty that Octobershine or April: their simple and puerile desiredrinks all light until the blood comes.
Even on the blackest days, when the sky dies,they strive towards Christmas, beneath a harshand haggard cloud, the moment the first ray dartsthrough.
You, our souls, do as they; they have not thepride of the lilies; but within their folds theyguard a holy and immortal ardour.
Ardour of senses, ardour of hearts, ardour ofsouls, vain words created by those who diminishlove; sun, you do not distinguish among yourflames those of evening, of dawn, or of noon!
You walk blinded by your own light in the torridazure under the great arched skies, knowingnothing, unless it be that your strength isall-powerful and that your fire labours at thedivine mysteries.
For love is an act of ceaseless exaltation. O youwhose gentleness bathes my proud heart, what needto weigh the pure gold of our dream? I love youaltogether, with my whole being.
The still beauty of summer evenings on thegreenswards where they lie outspread holds out tous, without empty gesture or words, a symbol ofrest in gladness.
Young morning and its tricks has gone away withthe breezes; noon itself and the velvet skirtsof its warm winds, of its heavy winds, no longersweeps the torrid plain; and this is the hourwhen, without a branch's moving or a pond'sruffling its waters, the evening slowly comesfrom the tops of the mountains and takes its seatin the garden.
O the infinite golden flatness of the waters, andthe trees and their shadows on the reeds, andthe calm and sumptuous silence in whose stillpresence we so greatly delight that we desire tolive with it always or to die of it and reviveby it, like two imperishable hearts tirelesslydrunken with brightness.
You said to me, one evening, words so beautifulthat doubtless the flowers that leaned towards ussuddenly loved us, and one among them, in orderto touch us both, fell upon our knees.
You spoke to me of a time nigh at hand when ouryears like over-ripe fruit would be ready for thegathering, how the knell of destiny would ringout, and how we should love each other, feelingourselves growing old.
Your voice enfolded me like a dear embrace, andyour heart burned so quietly beautiful, that atthat moment I could have seen without fear thebeginning of the tortuous roads that lead to thetomb.
Hours of bright morning, "Hours of afternoon,"hours that stand out superbly and gently, whosedance lengthens along our warm garden-paths,saluted at passing by our golden rose-trees;summer is dying and autumn coming in.
Hours girt with blossom, will you ever return?
Yet, if destiny, that wields the stars, spares usits pains, its blows and its disasters, perhapsone day you will return, and, before my eyes,interweave in measure your radiant steps;
And I will mingle with your glowing, gentledance, winding in shade and sun over the lawns--like a last, immense and supreme hope--thesteps and farewells of my "hours of evening."THE HOURS OF EENING
Dainty flowers, like a froth of foam, grew alongthe borders of our paths; the wind fell and theair seemed to brush your hands and hair withplumes.
The shade was kindly to us as we walked in stepbeneath the leafage; a child's song reached usfrom a village, and filled all the infinite.
Our ponds were outspread in their autumnsplendour under the guard of the long reeds, andthe lofty, swaying crown on the woods' fine browwas mirrored in the waters.
And both knowing that our hearts were broodingtogether on the same thought, we reflected thatit was our calmed life that was revealed to us inthis lovely evening.
For one supreme moment, you saw the festival skydeck itself out and say farewell to us; and for along, long while you gave it your eyes filled tothe brim with mute caresses.
If it were true that a garden flower or a meadowtree could keep some memory of lovers of othertimes who admired them in their bloom or theirvigour, our love in this hour of long regretwould come and entrust to the rose or erectin the oak, before the approach of death, itssweetness or its strength.
Thus it would survive, victor over funereal care,in the tranquil godship conferred on it by simplethings; it would still enjoy the pure brightnesscast on life by a summer dawn and the soft rainhanging to the leaves.
And if on a fine evening, out of the depths ofthe plain, a couple came along, holding hands,the oak would stretch out its broad and powerfulshade like a wing over their path, and the rosewould waft them its frail perfume.
The wistaria is faded and the hawthorn dead; butthis is the season of the heather in flower, andon this calm and gentle evening the caressingwind brings you the perfumes of poor Campine.
Love them and breathe them in while brooding overits fate; its soil is bare and harsh and the windwars on it; pools make their holes in it; thesand preys on it, and the little left to it, ityet gives.
Once in autumn, we lived with it, with its plainand its woods, with its rain and its sky, even toDecember when the Christmas angels crossed itslegend with mighty strokes of their wings.
Your heart became more steadfast there, simplerand more human; we loved the people of its oldvillages, and the women who spoke to us of theirgreat age and of spinning-wheels fallen from use,worn out by their hands.
Our calm house on the misty heath was bright tolook upon and ready in its welcome; and dear tous were its roof and its door and its thresholdand its hearth blackened by the smoky peat.
When night spread out its total splendour overthe vast and pale and innumerable somnolence, thesilence taught us lessons, the glow of which oursoul has never forgotten.
Because we felt more lonely in the vast plain,the dawns and the evenings sank more deeplyinto us; our eyes were franker, our hearts weregentler and filled to the brim with the fervourof the world.
We found happiness by not asking for it; even thesadness of the days was good for us, and the fewsun-rays of that end of autumn gladdened us allthe more because they seemed weak and tired.
The wistaria is faded and the hawthorn dead; butthis is the season of the heather in flower. Thisevening, remember, and let the caressing windbring you the perfumes of poor Campine.
Draw up your chair near mine, and stretch yourhands out towards the hearth that I may seebetween your fingers the old flame burning; andwatch the fire quietly with your eyes that fearno light, that they may be for me still frankerwhen a quick and flashing ray strikes to theirdepths, illuminating them.
Oh! how beautiful and young still our life iswhen the clock rings out with its golden tone,and, coming closer, I brush you lightly and touchyou, and a slow and gentle fever that neitherdesires to allay leads the sure and wondrouskiss from the hands to the forehead and from theforehead to the lips.
How I love you then, my bright beloved, in yourwelcoming, gently swooning body, that encirclesme in its turn and dissolves me in its gladness!Everything becomes dearer to me--your mouth, yourarms, your kindly breasts where my poor, tiredforehead will lie quietly near your heart afterthe moment of riotous pleasure that you grant me.
For I love you still better after the sensualhour, when your goodness, still more steadfastand maternal, makes for me a soft repose,following sharp ardour, and when, after desirehas cried out its violence, I hear approachingour regular happiness with steps so gentle thatthey are but silence.
Be once more merciful and cheering to us, light,pale brightness of winter that will bathe ourbrows when of an afternoon we both go into thegarden to breathe in one last warmth.
We loved you long ago with so great a pride, withso great a love springing from our hearts, thatone supreme and gentle and kindly flame is due tous at this hour when grief awaits us.
You are that which no man ever forgets, from theday when you first struck his victorious arms,and when, on the coming of evening, you slept inhis eyes with your dead splendour and vanquishedstrength.
And for us you were always the visible fervourthat, being everywhere diffused and shining infevers of deep and stinging ardour, seemed tostart for the infinite from our heart.
Alas! the days of the crimson phlox and of theproud roses that brightened its gates are faraway, but however faded and withered it maybe--what matters!--I love our garden still withall my heart.
Its distress is sometimes dearer and sweeter tome than was its gladness in the burning summerdays. Oh! the last perfume slowly rendered up byits last flower on its last mosses!
I wandered this evening among its windingpathways, to touch with my earnest fingers allits plants; and falling on my knees amid thetrembling grasses, I gave a long kiss to its dampand heavy soil.
And now let it die, and the mist and night comeand spread over all; all my being seems tohave entered into our garden's ruin, and, byunderstanding its death, I shall learn to know myown.
The evening falls, the moon is golden.
Before the day ends, go gaily into the garden andpluck with your gentle hands the few flowers thathave not yet bowed sadly towards the earth.
Though their leaves may be wan, what matters! Iadmire them and you love them, and their petalsare beautiful, in spite of all, on the stalksthat bear them.
And you went away into the distance among thebox-trees, along a monotonous path, and thenosegay that you plucked trembled in your handand suddenly quivered; and then your dreamingfingers devoutly gathered together theseglimmering autumn roses and wove them with tearsinto a pale and bright and supple crown.
The last light lit up your eyes, and your longstep became sad and silent.
And slowly in the twilight you returned withempty hands to the house, leaving not far fromour door, on a damp, low hillock, the whitecircle that your fingers had formed.
And I understood then that in the weary gardenwherethrough the winds will soon pass likesquadrons, you desired for the last time to adornwith flowers our youth that lies there dead.
When your hand, on an evening of the sluggishmonths, commits to the odorous cupboards thefruits of your orchard, I seem to see you calmlyarranging our old perfumed and sweet-tastingmemories.
And my relish for them returns, as it was informer years in the gold and the sun and withthe wind on my lips; and then I see a thousandmoments done and gone, and their gladness andtheir laughter and their cries and their fevers.
The past reawakens with so great a desire to bethe present still, with its life and strength,that the hardly extinguished fires suddenly burnmy body, and my heart rejoices to the point ofswooning.
O beautiful luminous fruits in these autumnshadows, jewels fallen from the heavy necklaceof russet summer, splendours that light up ourmonotonous hours, what a ruddy and spaciousawakening you stir up in us!
And now that the lofty leaves have fallen, thatkept our garden sheltered beneath their shade,through the bare branches can be seen beyond themthe roofs of the old villages climbing towardsthe horizon.
So long as summer poured out its gladness, noneof us saw them grouped so near our door; but nowthat the flowers and the leaves are withered, weoften brood on them with gentle thoughts.
Other people live there between stone walls,behind a worn threshold protected by a coping,having as sole friends but the wind and the rainand the lamp shining with its friendly light.
In the darkness at the fall of evening, when thefire awakens and the clock in which time swingsis hushed, doubtless, as much as we, they lovethe silence, to feel themselves thinking throughtheir eyes.
Nothing disturbs for them or for us those hoursof deep and quiet and tender intimacy wherein themoment that was is blessed for having been, andof which the coming hour is always the best.
Indeed, how they also clench the old happiness,made up of pain and joy, within their tremblinghands; they know each other's bodies that havegrown old together, and each other's looks wornout by the same sorrows.
The roses of their life, they love them faded,with their dead glory and their last perfume andthe heavy memory of their dead brightness fallingaway, leaf by leaf, in the garden of the years.
Against black winter, like hermits, they staycrouching within their human fervour, and nothingdisheartens them and nothing leads them tocomplain of the days they no longer possess.
Oh! the quiet people in the depths of oldvillages! Indeed, do we not feel them neighboursof our heart! And do we not find in their eyesour tears and in their courage our strength andardour!
They are there beneath their roof, seatedaround fires, or lingering sometimes at theirwindow-sill; and on this evening of spacious,floating wind, perhaps they have thought of uswhat we think of them.
When the starry sky covers our dwelling, we hushfor hours before its intense and gentle fire,so that we may feel a greater and more ferventstirring within us.
The great silver stars follow their courses highup in the heavens; beneath the flames and thegleams, night spreads out its depths, and thecalm is so great that the ocean listens!
But what matters even the hushing of the sea, ifin the brightness and immensity of space, full ofinvisible violence, our hearts beat so stronglythat they make all the silence?
With the same love that you were for me long agoa garden of splendour whose wavering coppicesshaded the long grass and the docile roses,you are for me in these black days a calm andsteadfast sanctuary.
All is centred there: your fervour and yourbrightness and your movements assembling theflowers of your goodness; but all is drawntogether closely in a deep peace against thesharp winds piercing the winter of the world.
My happiness keeps warm there within your foldedarms; your pretty, artless words, in theirgladness and familiarity, sing still with asgreat a charm to my ears as in the days of thewhite lilac or of the red currants.
Oh! I feel your gay and shining cheerfulnesstriumphing day by day over the sorrow of theyears, and you yourself smile at the silverthreads that slip their waving network into yourglossy hair.
When your head bends to my deep-felt kiss, whatdoes it matter to me that your brow is furrowed,and that your hands are becoming ridged with hardveins when I hold them between my two steadfasthands!
You never complain, and you believe firmly thatnothing true dies when love receives its meed,and that the living fire on which our soul feedsconsumes even grief to increase its flame.
The flowers of bright welcome along the wallawait us no longer when we go indoors, and oursilken ponds whose smooth waters chafe lieoutstretched no more beneath pure, soft skies.
All the birds have fled our monotonous plains,and pallid fogs float over the marshes. O thosetwo cries: autumn, winter! winter, autumn! Do youhear the dead wood falling in the forest?
No more is our garden the husband of light,whence the phlox were seen springing towardstheir glory; our fiery gladioli are mingled withthe earth, and have lain down in their length todie.
Everything is nerveless and void of beauty;everything is flameless and passes and flees andbends and sinks down unsupported. Oh! give meyour eyes lit up by your soul that I may seek inthem in spite of all a corner of the old sky.
In them alone our light lives still, the lightthat covered all the garden long ago, when itexulted with the white pride of our lilies andthe climbing ardour of our hollyhocks.
When the fine snow with its sparkling grainssilts over our threshold, I hear your footstepswander and stop in the neighbouring room.
You withdraw the bright and fragile mirror fromits place by the window, and your bunch ofkeys dances along the drawer of the beech-woodwardrobe.
I listen, and you are poking the fire andarousing the embers; and you are arranging aboutthe silent walls the silence of the chairs.
You remove the fleeting dust from the workbasketwith the narrow feet, and your ring strikes andresounds on the quivering sides of a wine-glass.
And I am more happy than ever this evening atyour tender presence, and at feeling you near andnot seeing you and ever hearing you.
If fate has saved us from commonplace errors andfrom vile untruth and from sorry shams, it isbecause all constraint that might have bowed ourdouble fervour revolted us.
You went your way, free and frank and bright,mingling with the flowers of love the flowers ofyour will, and gently lifting up towards yourselfits lofty spirit when my brow was bent towardsfear or doubt.
And you were always kind and artless in youracts, knowing that my heart was for ever yours;for if I loved--do I now know?--some other woman,it is to your heart that I always returned.
Your eyes were then so pure in their tears thatmy being was stirred to sincerity and truth; andI repeated to you holy and gentle words, and yourweapons were sadness and forgiveness.
And in the evening I lulled my head to sleep onyour bright bosom, happy at having returned fromfalse and dim distances to the fragrant springthat bore sway in us, and I remained a captive inyour open arms.
No, my heart has never tired of you.
In the time of June, long ago, you said to me:"If I knew, friend, if I knew that my presenceone day might be a burden to you-- with my poorheart and sorrowful thoughts, I would go away, nomatter where."
And gently your forehead rose towards my kiss.
And you said to me again: "Bonds loosen alwaysand life is so full, and what matters if thechain is golden that ties to the same ring inport our two human barks!"
And gently your tears revealed to me your grief.
And you said and you said again: "Let usseparate, let us separate before the evil days;our life has been too lofty to drag it triviallyfrom fault to fault."
And you fled and you fled, and my two handsdesperately held you back.
No, my heart has never tired of you.
How happy we are still and proud of living whenthe least ray of sunshine glimpsed in the heavenslights up for a moment the poor flowers of rimethat the hard and delicate frost engraved on ourwindow-panes.
Rapture leaps in us and hope carries us away, andour old garden appears to us again, in spite ofits long paths strewn with dead branches, livingand pure and bright and full of golden gleams.
Something shining and undaunted, I know not what,creeps into our blood; and in the quick kissesthat, ardently, frantically, we give each other,we re-embody the immensity and fulness of summer.
Shall we suffer, alas! the dead weight of theyears until at length we are no more than twoquiet people, exchanging the harmless kisses ofchildren at evening when the fire flames in thehollow of the chimney?
Shall our dear furniture see us drag ourselveswith slow steps from the hearth to the beechenchest, support ourselves by the wall to reach thewindow, and huddle our tottering bodies on heavyseats?
If our wreck is to appear one day in such guise,while numbness deadens our brains and our arms,we shall not bemoan, in spite of evil fate, andwe shall hold our tears pent up in our breasts.
For even so, we shall still keep our eyes withwhich to gaze on the day that follows night, andto see the dawn and the sun shed their radianceon life, and make a wonderful object of theearth.
The small happenings, the thousand nothings, aletter, a date, a humble anniversary, a word saidonce again as in days long ago uplift your heartand mine in these long evenings.
And we celebrate for ourselves these simplethings, and we count and recount our oldtreasures, so that the little of us that we stillkeep may remain steadfast and brave before thesullen hour.
And more than is fitting, we show ourselvessolicitous of these poor, gentle, kindly joysthat sit down on the bench near the flaming firewith winter flowers on their thin knees.
And they take from the chest where their goodnesshides it the bright bread of happiness that wasallotted to us, and of which Love in our househas so long eaten that he loves it even to thecrumbs.
Come even to our threshold, scattering yourwhite ash, O peaceful, slowly falling snow: thelime-tree in the garden holds all its branchesbowed, and the light calandra dissolves in thesky no longer.
O snow, who warm and protect the barely risingcorn with the moss and wool that you spread fromplain to plain! Silent snow, the gentle friend ofthe houses asleep in the calm of morning:
Cover our roof and lightly touch our windows, andsuddenly enter by the door over the thresholdwith your pure flakes and your dancing flames,
O snow, luminous through our soul, snow, who alsowarm our last dreams like the rising corn!
When our bright garden was gay with all itsflowers, the regret at having shrunk our heartssprang from our lips in moments of passion; andforgiveness, offered but deserved always, andthe exaggerated display of our wretchedness andso many tears moistening our sad, sincere eyesuplifted our love.
But in these months of heavy rain, wheneverything huddles together and makes itselfsmall, when brightness itself tires of thrustingback shadow and night, our soul is no longervibrant and strong enough to confess our faultswith rapture.
We tell them in slow speech; in truth, withaffection still, but at the fall of the eveningand no longer at dawn; sometimes even we countthem on our ten fingers like things that wenumber and arrange in the house, and to lessentheir folly or their number we debate them.
With my old hands lifted to your forehead,during your brief sleep by the black hearth thisevening, I part your hair, and I kiss the fervourof your eyes hidden beneath your long lashes.
Oh! the sweet affection of this day's end! Myeyes follow the years that have completed theircourse, and suddenly your life appears so perfectin them that my love is moved by a touchingrespect.
And as in the time when you were my betrothed,the desire comes back to me again in all itsardour to fall on my knees, and with fingers aschaste as my thoughts to touch the place whereyour gentle heart beats.
If our hearts have burned in uplifting days witha love as bright as it was lofty, age now makesus slack and indulgent and mild before our faults.
You no longer make us greater, O youthful will,with your unsubdued ardour, and our life iscoloured now with gentle calm and pale kindliness.
We are at the setting of your sun, love, and wemask our weakness with the common-place words andpoor speeches of an empty, tardy wisdom.
Oh! how sad and shameful would the future be forus if from our winter and our mistiness theredid not break out like a torch the memory of thehigh-spirited souls we once were.
In this rugged winter when the floating sunfounders on the horizon like a heavy wreck, Ilove to say your name, with its slow, solemntone, as the clock echoes with the deep strokesof time.
And the more I say it, the more ravished is myvoice, so much so that from my lips it descendsinto my heart and awakens in me a more glowinghappiness than the sweetest words I have spokenin my life.
And before the new dawn or the evening fallingto sleep, I repeat it with my voice that is everthe same, but oh! with what strength and supremeardour shall I pronounce it at the hour of death!
Perhaps, when my last day comes, perhaps, if onlyfor a moment, a frail and quavering sun willstoop down at my window.
My hands then, my poor faded hands, will even sobe gilded once again by his glory; he will touchmy mouth and my forehead a last time with hisslow, bright, deep kiss; and the pale, but stillproud flowers of my eyes will return his lightbefore they close.
Sun, have I not worshipped your strength and yourbrightness! My torrid, gentle art, in its supremeachievement has held you captive in the heart ofmy poems; like a field of ripe wheat that surgesin the summer wind, this page and that of mybooks confers life on you and exhalts you:
O Sun, who bring forth and deliver, O immensefriend of whom our pride has need, be it that atthe new, solemn and imperious hour when my oldhuman heart will be heavy under the proof, youwill come once more to visit it and witness.
Oh! how gentle are your hands and their slowcaress winding about my neck and gliding over mybody, when I tell you at the fall of evening howmy strength grows heavy day by day with the leadof my weakness!
You do not wish me to become a shadow and a wrecklike those who go towards the darkness, eventhough they carry a laurel in their mournfulhands and fame sleeping in their hollow chest.
Oh! how you soften the law of time for me, andhow comforting and generous to me is your dream;for the first time, with an untruth you lull myheart, that forgives you and thanks you for it,
Well knowing, nevertheless, that all ardour isvain against all that is and all that must be,and that, by finishing in your eyes my fine humanlife, may perhaps be found a deep happiness.
When you have closed my eyes to the light, kissthem with a long kiss, for they will have givenyou in the last look of their last fervour theutmost passionate love.
Beneath the still radiance of the funeral torch,bend down towards the farewell in them your sadand beautiful face, so that the only image theywill keep in the tomb may be imprinted on themand may endure.
And let me feel, before the coffin is nailed up,our hands meet once again on the pure, white bed,and your cheek rest one last time against myforehead on the pale cushions.
And let me afterwards go far away with my heart,which will preserve so fiery a love for you thatthe other dead will feel its glow even throughthe compact, dead earth!

LETTER I
Beloved: This is your first letter from me: yet it is not the first I havewritten to you
 There are letters to you lying at love's dead-letteroffice in this same writing--so many, my memory has lost count of them!This is my confession: I told you I had one to make, and you laughed:--youdid not know how serious it was--for to be in love with you long beforeyou were in love with me--nothing can be more serious than that!You deny that I was: yet I know when you first really loved me
 All atonce, one day something about me came upon you as a surprise: and how,except on the road to love, can there be surprises? And in the surprisecame love
 You did not _know_ me before
 Before then, it was only theother nine entanglements which take hold of the male heart and occupy ittill the tenth is ready to make one knot of them all
In the letter written that day, I said, "You love me
" I could neverhave said it before; though I had written twelve letters to my love foryou, I had not once been able to write of your love for me
 Was not_that_ serious?Now I have confessed! I thought to discover myself all blushes, but myface is cool: you have kissed all my blushes away! Can I ever be ashamedin your eyes now, or grow rosy because of anything _you_ or _I_ think?So!--you have robbed me of one of my charms: I am brazen
 Can you loveme still?You love me, you love me; you are wonderful! we are both wonderful, youand I
Well, it is good for you to know I have waited and wished, long beforethe thing came true
 But to see _you_ waiting and wishing, when thething _was_ true all the time:--oh! that was the trial! How not suddenlyto throw my arms round you and cry, "Look, see! O blind mouth, why areyou famished?"And you never knew? Dearest, I love you for it, you never knew! I believea man, when he finds he has won, thinks he has taken the city by assault:he does not guess how to the insiders it has been a weary siege, withflags of surrender fluttering themselves to rags from every wall andwindow! No: in love it is the women who are the strategists: and they haveat last to fall into the ambush they know of with a good grace
You must let me praise myself a little for the past, since I can neverpraise myself again
 You must do that for me now! There is not a battleleft for me to win
 You and peace hold me so much a prisoner, have socaught me from my own way of living, that I seem to hear a pin droptwenty years ahead of me: it seems an event! Dearest, a thousand times,I would not have it be otherwise: I am only too willing to drop out ofexistence altogether and find myself in your arms instead
 Giving you mylove, I can so easily give you my life
 Ah, my dear, I am yours soutterly, so gladly! Will you ever find it out, you who took so long todiscover anything?LETTER II
Dearest: Your name woke me this morning: I found my lips piping their songbefore I was well back into my body out of dreams
 I wonder if the roguesbabble when my spirit is nesting? Last night you were a high tree and Iwas in it, the wind blowing us both; but I forget the rest,--whatever, itwas enough to make me wake happy
There are dreams that go out like candle-light directly one opens theshutters: they illumine the walls no longer; the daylight is too strongfor them
 So, now, I can hardly remember anything of my dreams:daylight, with you in it, floods them out
Oh, how are you? Awake? Up? Have you breakfasted? I ask you a thousandthings
 You are thinking of me, I know: but what are you thinking? I amdevoured by curiosity about myself--none at all about you, whom I have allby heart! If I might only know how happy I make you, and just _which_thing I said yesterday is making you laugh to-day--I could cry with joyover being the person I am
It is you who make me think so much about myself, trying to find myselfout
 I used to be most self-possessed, and regarded it as the crowningvirtue: and now--your possession of me sweeps it away, and I stand cryingto be let into a secret that is no longer mine
 Shall I ever know _why_you love me? It is my religious difficulty; but it never rises into adoubt
 You _do_ love me, I know
 _Why_, I don't think I ever can know
You ask me the same question about yourself, and it becomes absurd,because I altogether belong to you
 If I hold my breath for a momentwickedly (for I can't do it breathing), and try to look at the worldwith you out of it, I seem to have fallen over a precipice; or rather,the solid earth has slipped from under my feet, and I am off intovacuum
 Then, as I take breath again for fear, my star swims up andclasps me, and shows me your face
 O happy star this that I was bornunder, that moved with me and winked quiet prophecies at me all throughmy childhood, I not knowing what it meant:--the dear radiant thingnaming to me my lover!As a child, now and then, and for no reason, I used to be sublimelyhappy: real wings took hold of me
 Sometimes a field became fairylandas I walked through it; or a tree poured out a scent that its blossomsnever had before or after
 I think now that those must have been momentswhen you too were in like contact with earth,--had your feet in grasswhich felt a faint ripple of wind, or stood under a lilac in a drench offragrance that had grown double after rain
When I asked you about the places of your youth, I had some fear offinding that we might once have met, and that I had not remembered it asthe summing up of my happiness in being young
 Far off I see somethingundiscovered waiting us, something I could not have guessed atbefore--the happiness of being old
 Will it not be something like theevening before last when we were sitting together, your hand in mine,and one by one, as the twilight drew about us, the stars came and tookup their stations overhead? They seemed to me then to be following outsome quiet train of thought in the universal mind: the heavens wereremembering the stars back into their places:--the Ancient of Daysdrawing upon the infinite treasures of memory in his great lifetime
Will not Love's old age be the same to us both--a starry place ofmemories?Your dear letter is with me while I write: how shortly you are able tosay everything! To-morrow you will come
 What more do I want--exceptto-morrow itself, with more promises of the same thing?You are at my heart, dearest: nothing in the world can be nearer to methan you!LETTER III
Dearest and rightly Beloved: You cannot tell how your gift has pleased me;or rather you _can_, for it shows you have a long memory back to our firstmeeting: though at the time I was the one who thought most of it
It is quite true; you have the most beautifully shaped memory inChristendom: these are the very books in the very edition I have longwanted, and have been too humble to afford myself
 And now I cannot stopto read one, for joy of looking at them all in a row
 I will kiss youfor them all, and for more besides: indeed it is the "besides" whichbrings you my kisses at all
Now that you have chosen so perfectly to my mind, I may proffer arequest which, before, I was shy of making
 It seems now beneficentlyanticipated
 It is that you will not ever let your gifts take the formof jewelry, not after the ring which you are bringing me: _that_, youknow, I both welcome and wish for
 But, as to the rest, the world hassupplied me with a feeling against jewelry as a love-symbol
 Lookabroad and you will see: it is too possessive, too much like "chains ofoffice"--the fair one is to wear her radiant harness before the world,that other women may be envious and the desire of her master's eye besatisfied! Ah, no!I am yours, dear, utterly; and nothing you give me would have that sense:I know you too well to think it
 But in the face of the present fashion(and to flout it), which expects the lover to give in this sort, and thebeloved to show herself a dazzling captive, let me cherish my ritual ofopposition which would have no meaning if we were in a world of our own,and no place in my thoughts, dearest;--as it has not now, so far as youare concerned
 But I am conscious I shall be looked at as your chosen; andI would choose my own way of how to look back most proudly
And so for the books more thanks and more,--that they are what I wouldmost wish, and not anything else: which, had they been, they would stillhave given me pleasure, since from you they could come only with a goodmeaning: and--diamonds even--I could have put up with them!To-morrow you come for your ring, and bring me my own? Yours is herewaiting
 I have it on my finger, very loose, with another standingsentry over it to keep it from running away
A mouse came out of my wainscot last night, and plunged me in horribledilemma: for I am equally idiotic over the idea of the creature trappedor free, and I saw sleepless nights ahead of me till I had secured achange of locality for him
To startle him back into hiding would have only deferred my gettingtruly rid of him, so I was most tiptoe and diplomatic in my doings
Finally, a paper bag, put into a likely nook with some sentimentallypreserved wedding-cake crumbled into it, crackled to me of his arrival
In a brave moment I noosed the little beast, bag and all, and loweredhim from the window by string, till the shrubs took from me the burdenof responsibility
I visited the bag this morning: he had eaten his way out, crumbs andall: and has, I suppose, become a fieldmouse, for the hay smellsinvitingly, and it is only a short run over the lawn and a jump over theha-ha to be in it
 Poor morsels, I prefer them so much undomesticated!Now this mouse is no allegory, and the paper bag is _not_ a diamondnecklace, in spite of the wedding-cake sprinkled over it! So don't saythat this letter is too hard for your understanding, or you willfrighten me from telling you anything foolish again
 Brains are likejewels in this, difference of surface has nothing to do with the sizeand value of them
 Yours is a beautiful smooth round, like a pearl, andmine all facets and flashes like cut glass
 And yours so much thebigger, and I love it so much the best! The trap which caught me wasbaited with one great pearl
 So the mouse comes in with a meaning tiedto its tail after all!LETTER IV
In all the world, dearest, what is more unequal than love between a manand a woman? I have been spending an amorous morning and want to share itwith you: but lo, the task of bringing that bit of my life into yourvision is altogether beyond me
What have I been doing? Dear man, I have been dressmaking! and dress,when one is in the toils, is but a love-letter writ large
 You will seeand admire the finished thing, but you will take no interest in thecomposition
 Therefore I say your love is unequal to mine
For think how ravished I would be if you brought me a coat and told meit was all your own making! One day you had thrown down a meretailor-made thing in the hall, and yet I kissed it as I went by
 Andthat was at a time when we were only at the handshaking stage, thepalsied beginnings of love:--_you_, I mean!But oh, to get you interested in the dress I was making to youto-day!--the beautiful flowing opening,--not too flowing: the elaboratecentral composition where the heart of me has to come, and the wind-upof the skirt, a long reluctant tailing-off, full of commas and colons ofribbon to make it seem longer, and insertions everywhere
 I dreamedmyself in it, retiring through the door after having bidden yougood-night, and you watching the long disappearing eloquence of thattail, still saying to you as it vanished, "Good-by, good-by
 I love youso! see me, how slowly I am going!"Well, that is a bit of my dress-making, a very corporate part of myaffection for you; and you are not a bit interested, for I have shownyou none of the seamy side; it is that which interests you malecreatures, Zolaites, every one of you
And what have you to show similar, of the thought of me entering intoall your masculine pursuits? Do you go out rabbit-shooting for the loveof me? If so, I trust you make a miss of it every time! That you are asportsman is one of the very hardest things in life that I have to bear
Last night Peterkins came up with me to keep guard against any furtherintrusion of mice
 I put her to sleep on the couch: but she discardedthe red shawl I had prepared for her at the bottom, and lay at the topmost uncomfortably in a parcel of millinery into which from one end Ihad already made excavations, so that it formed a large bag
 Into thefurther end of this bag Turks crept and snuggled down: but every timeshe turned in the night (and it seemed very often) the brown papercrackled and woke me up
 So at last I took it up and shook out itscontents; and Pippins slept soundly on red flannel till Nan-nan broughtthe tea
You will notice that in this small narrative Peterkins gets three names:it is a fashion that runs through the household, beginning with theMother-Aunt, who on some days speaks of Nan-nan as "the old lady," andsometimes as "that girl," all according to the two tempers she has aboutNan-nan's privileged position in regard to me
You were only here yesterday, and already I want you again so much, somuch!    Your never satisfied but always loving
LETTER V
Most Beloved: I have been thinking, staring at this blank piece of paper,and wondering how _there_ am I ever to say what I have in me here--notwishing to say anything at all, but just to be! I feel that I am livingnow only because you love me: and that my life will have run out, likethis penful of ink, when that use in me is past
 Not yet, Beloved, oh, notyet! Nothing is finished that we have to do and be:--hardly begun! I willnot call even this "midsummer," however much it seems so: it is still onlyspring
Every day your love binds me more deeply than I knew the day before: sothat no day is the same now, but each one a little happier than the last
My own, you are my very own! And yet, true as that is, it is not so trueas that I am _your_ own
 It is less absolute, I mean; and must be so,because I cannot very well _take_ possession of anything when I am givenover heart and soul out of my own possession: there isn't enough identityleft in me, I am yours so much, so much! All this is useless to say, yetwhat can I say else, if I have to begin saying anything?Could I truly be your "star and goddess," as you call me, Beloved, Iwould do you the service of Thetis at least (who did it for a greaterthan herself)--    "Bid Heaven and Earth combine their charms,       And round you early, round you late,     Briareus fold his hundred arms      To guard you from your single fate
"But I haven't got power over an eight-armed octopus even: so am merely avery helpless loving nonentity which merges itself most happily in you,and begs to be lifted to no pedestal at all, at all
If you love me in a manner that is at all possible, you will see that"goddess" does not suit me
 "Star" I would I were now, with a wide eyeto carry my looks to you over this horizon which keeps you invisible
Choose one, if you will, dearest, and call it mine: and to me it shallbe yours: so that when we are apart and the stars come out, our eyes maymeet up at the same point in the heavens, and be "keeping company" forus among the celestial bodies--with their permission: for I have toolively a sense of their beauty not to be a little superstitious aboutthem
 Have you not felt for yourself a sort of physiognomy in theconstellations,--most of them seeming benevolent and full of kindregards:--but not all? I am always glad when the Great Bear goes awayfrom my window, fine beast though he is: he seems to growl at me! Nodoubt it is largely a question of names; and what's in a name? In yours,Beloved, when I speak it, more than I can compass!LETTER VI
Beloved: I have been trusting to fate, while keeping silence, thatsomething from you was to come to-day and make me specially happy
 And ithas: bless you abundantly! You have undone and got round all I said about"jewelry," though this is nothing of the sort, but a shrine: so my wordremains
 I have it with me now, safe hidden, only now and then it comesout to have a look at me,--smiles and goes back again
 Dearest, you must_feel_ how I thank you, for I cannot say it: body and soul I grow too muchblessed with all that you have given me, both visibly and invisibly, andalways perfectly
And as for the day: I have been thinking you the most uncurious of men,because you had not asked: and supposed it was too early days yet foryou to remember that I had ever been born
 To-day is my birthday! yousaid nothing, so I said nothing; and yet this has come: I trusted mystar to show its sweet influences in its own way
 Or, after all, did youknow, and had you asked anyone but me? Yet had you known, you wouldhave wished me the "happy returns" which among all your dear words to meyou do not
 So I take it that the motion comes straight to you fromheaven; and, in the event, you will pardon me for having been stillsecretive and shy in not telling what you did not inquire after
_Yours_, I knew, dear, quite long ago, so had no need to ask you for it
And it is six months before you will be in the same year with me again,and give to twenty-two all the companionable sweetness that twenty-onehas been having
Many happy returns of _my_ birthday to you, dearest! That is all that mybirthdays are for
 Have you been happy to-day, I wonder? and amwondering also whether this evening we shall see you walking quietly inand making everything into perfection that has been trembling just onthe verge of it all day long
One drawback of my feast is that I have to write short to you; for thereare other correspondents who on this occasion look for quick answers,and not all of them to be answered in an offhand way
 Except you, it isthe coziest whom I keep waiting; but elders have a way with them--evenkind ones: and when they condescend to write upon an anniversary, wehave to skip to attention or be in their bad books at once
So with the sun still a long way out of bed, I have to tuck up thesesheets for you, as if the good of the day had already been sufficientunto itself and its full tale had been told
 Good-night
 It is so hardto take my hands off writing to you, and worry on at the same exercisein another direction
 I kiss you more times than I can count: it isalmost really you that I kiss now! My very dearest, my own sweetheart,whom I so worship
 Good-night! "Good-afternoon" sounds too funny: isoutside our vocabulary altogether
 While I live, I must love you morethan I know!LETTER VII
My Friend: Do you think this a cold way of beginning? I do not: is it notthe true send-off of love? I do not know how men fall in love: but I couldnot have had that come-down in your direction without being your friendfirst
 Oh, my dear, and after, after; it is but a limitless friendship Ihave grown into!I have heard men run down the friendships of women as having little truesubstance
 Those who speak so, I think, have never come across a realcase of woman's friendship
 I praise my own sex, dearest, for I knowsome of their loneliness, which you do not: and until a certain datetheir friendship was the deepest thing in life I had met with
For must it not be true that a woman becomes more absorbed in friendshipthan a man, since friendship may have to mean so much more to her, andcover so far more of her life, than it does to the average man? Howeverbig a man's capacity for friendship, the beauty of it does not fill hiswhole horizon for the future: he still looks ahead of it for the matewho will complete his life, giving his body and soul the complementthey require
 Friendship alone does not satisfy him: he makes a biggerclaim on life, regarding certain possessions as his right
But a woman:--oh, it is a fashion to say the best women are sure to findhusbands, and have, if they care for it, the certainty before them of afull life
 I know it is not so
 There are women, wonderful ones, whocome to know quite early in life that no men will ever wish to makewives of them: for them, then, love in friendship is all that remains,and the strongest wish of all that can pass through their souls withhope for its fulfillment is to be a friend to somebody
It is man's arrogant certainty of his future which makes him impatientof the word "friendship": it cools life to his lips, he so confidentthat the headier nectar is his due!I came upon a little phrase the other day that touched me so deeply: itsaid so well what I have wanted to say since we have known each other
Some peasant rhymer, an Irishman, is singing his love's praises, andsinks his voice from the height of his passionate superlatives to callher his "share of the world
" Peasant and Irishman, he knew that hisfortune did not embrace the universe: but for him his love was justthat--his share of the world
Surely when in anyone's friendship we seem to have gained our share ofthe world, that is all that can be said
 It means all that we can takein, the whole armful the heart and senses are capable of, or that fatecan bestow
 And for how many that must be friendship--especially for howmany women!My dear, you are my share of the world, also my share of Heaven: butthere I begin to speak of what I do not know, as is the way with happyhumanity
 All that my eyes could dream of waking or sleeping, all thatmy ears could be most glad to hear, all that my heart could beat fasterto get hold of--your friendship gave me suddenly as a bolt from theblue
My friend, my friend, my friend! If you could change or go out of mylife now, the sun would drop out of my heavens: I should see the worldwith a great piece gashed out of its side,--my share of it gone
 No, Ishould not see it, I don't think I should see anything ever again,--nottruly
Is it not strange how often to test our happiness we harp on sorrow? Ido: don't let it weary you
 I know I have read somewhere that great lovealways entails pain
 I have not found it yet: but, for me, it does meanfear,--the sort of fear I had as a child going into big buildings
 Iloved them: but I feared, because of their bigness, they were likely totumble on me
But when I begin to think you may be too big for me, I remember you asmy "friend," and the fear goes for a time, or becomes that sort of fearI would not part with if I might
I have no news for you: only the old things to tell you, the wonder ofwhich ever remains new
 How holy your face has become to me: as I saw itlast, with something more than the usual proofs of love for me uponit--a look as if your love troubled you! I know the trouble: I feel it,dearest, in my own woman's way
 Have patience
--When I see you so, Ifeel that prayer is the only way given me for saying what my love foryou wishes to be
 And yet I hardly ever pray in words
Dearest, be happy when you get this: and, when you can, come and give myhappiness its rest
 Till then it is a watchman on the lookout
"Night-night!" Your true sleepy one
LETTER VIII
Now _why_, I want to know, Beloved, was I so specially "good" to you in mylast? I have been quite as good to you fifty times before,--if such athing can be from me to you
 Or do you mean good _for_ you? Then, dear, Imust be sorry that the thing stands out so much as an exception!Oh, dearest Beloved, for a little I think I must not love you so much,or must not let you see it
When does your mother return, and when am I to see her? I long to somuch
 Has she still not written to you about our news?I woke last night to the sound of a great flock of sheep going past
 Isuppose they were going by forced marches to the fair over at Hylesbury:It was in the small hours: and a few of them lifted up their voices andcomplained of this robbery of night and sleep in the night
 They were sotired, so tired, they said: and so did the muffawully patter of theirpoor feet
 The lambs said most; and the sheep agreed with a huskycroak
I said a prayer for them, and went to sleep again as the sound of thelambs died away; but somehow they stick in my heart, those sad sheepdriven along through the night
 It was in its degree like the womanhurrying along, who said, "My God, my God!" that summer Sunday morning
These notes from lives that appear and disappear remain endlessly; and Ido not think our hearts can have been made so sensitive to suffering wecan do nothing to relieve, without some good reason
 So I tell you this,as I would any sorrow of my own, because it has become a part of me, andis underlying all that I think to-day
I am to expect you the day after to-morrow, but "not for certain"? Thusyou give and you take away, equally blessed in either case
 All thesame, I shall _certainly_ expect you, and be disappointed if on Thursdayat about this hour your way be not my way
"How shall I my true love know" if he does not come often enough to seeme? Sunshine be on you all possible hours till we meet again
LETTER IX
Beloved: Is the morning looking at you as it is looking at me? A little tothe right of the sun there lies a small cloud, filmy and faint, but enoughto cast a shadow somewhere
 From this window, high up over the view, Icannot see where the shadow of it falls,--further than my eye can reach:perhaps just now over you, since you lie further west
 But I cannot besure
 We cannot be sure about the near things in this world; only aboutwhat is far off and fixed
You and I looking up see the same sun, if there are no clouds over us:but we may not be looking at the same clouds even when both our heartsare in shadow
 That is so, even when hearts are as close together asyours and mine: they respond to the same light: but each one has its ownroof of shadow, wearing its rue with a world of difference
Why is it? why can no two of us have sorrows quite in common? What canbe nearer together than our wills to be one? In joy we are; and yet,though I reach and reach, and sadden if you are sad, I cannot make yoursorrow my own
I suppose sorrow is of the earth earthy: and all that is of earth makesdivision
 Every joy that belongs to the body casts shadows somewhere
 Iwonder if there can enter into us a joy that has no shadow anywhere? Thejoy of having you has behind it the shadow of parting; is there any wayof loving that would make parting no sorrow at all? To me, now, the ideaseems treason! I cling to my sorrow that you are not here: I send up mycloud, as it were, to catch the sun's brightness: it is a kite that Ipull with my heart-strings
To the sun of love the clouds that cover absence must look like whiteflowers in the green fields of earth, or like doves hovering: and hereaches down and strokes them with his warm beams, making all theirfeathers like gold
Some clouds let the gold come through; _mine_, now
--That cloud I sawaway to the right is coming this way toward me
 I can see the shadow ofit now, moving along a far-off strip of road: and I wonder if it is_your_ cloud, with you under it coming to see me again!When you come, why am I any happier than when I know you are coming? Itis the same thing in love
 I have you now all in my mind's eye; I haveyou by heart; have I my arms a bit more round you then than now?How it puzzles me that, when love is perfect, there should bedisappearances and reappearances: and faces now and then showing achange!--You, actually, the last time you came, looking a day older thanthe day before! What was it? Had old age blown you a kiss, or given you awrinkle in the art of dying? Or had you turned over some new leaf, andfound it withered on the other side?I could not see how it was: I heard you coming--it was spring! The dooropened:--oh, it was autumnal! One day had fallen away like a leaf out ofmy forest, and I had not been there to see it go!At what hour of the twenty-four does a day shed itself out of our lives?Not, I think, on the stroke of the clock, at midnight, or at cock-crow
Some people, perhaps, would say--with the first sleep; and that the"beauty-sleep" is the new day putting out its green wings
 _I_ think itmust be not till something happens to make the new day a strongerimpression than the last
 So it would please me to think that youryesterday dropped off as you opened the door; and that, had I peeped andseen you coming up the stairs, I should have seen you looking a dayyounger
_That_ means that you age at the sight of me! I think you do
 I, I feela hundred on the road to immortality, directly your face dawns on me
There's a foot gone over my grave! The angel of the resurrection with hismouth pursed fast to his trumpet!--Nothing else than the gallop-a-gallopof your horse:--it sounds like a kettle boiling over!So this goes into hiding: listens to us all the while we talk; and comesout afterwards with all its blushes stale, to be rouged up again andsent off the moment your back is turned
 No, better!--to be slipped intoyour pocket and carried home to yourself _by_ yourself
 How, when youget to your destination and find it, you will curse yourself that youwere not a speedier postman!LETTER X
Dearest: Did you find your letter? The quicker I post, the quicker I needto sit down and write again
 The grass under love's feet never stopsgrowing: I must make hay of it while the sun shines
You say my metaphors make you giddy
--My clear, you, without a metaphorin your composition, do that to me! So it is not for you to complain;your curses simply fly back to roost
 Where do you pigeon-hole them? Ina pie? (I mean to write now until I have made you as giddy as a dancingdervish!) _Your_ letters are much more like blackbirds: and I have a pieof them here, twenty-four at least; and when I open it they sing"Chewee, chewee, chewee!" in the most scared way!Your last but three said most solemnly, just as if you meant it, "I hopeyou don't keep these miserables! Though I fill up my hollow hours withthem, there is no reason why they should fill up yours
" You added thatI was better occupied--and here I am "better occupied" even as you bidme
But one can jump best from a spring-board: and how could I jump as faras your arms by letter, if I had not yours to jump from?So you see they are kept, and my disobedience of you has begun: and Ifind disobedience wonderfully sweet
 But then, you gave me a law whichyou knew I should disobey:--that is the way the world began
 It is notfor nothing that I am a daughter of Eve
And here is our world in our hands, yours and mine, now in the making
Which day are the evening and the morning now? I think it must be thebirds'--and already, with the wings, disobedience has been reached! Makemuch of it! the day will come when I shall wish to obey
 There aremoments when I feel a wish taking hold of me stronger than I canunderstand, that you should command me beyond myself--to things I havenot strength or courage for of my own accord
 How close, dearest, whenthat day comes, my heart will feel itself to yours! It feels close now:but it is to your feet I am nearest, as yet
 Lift me! There, there,Beloved, I kiss you with all my will
 Oh, dear heart, forgive me forbeing no more than I am: your freehold to all eternity!LETTER XIOh, Dearest: I have danced and I have danced till I am tired! Iam dropping with sleep, but I must just touch you and say good-night
This was our great day of publishing, dearest, _ours_: all the worldknows it; and all admire your choice! I was determined they should
 Ihave been collecting scalps for you to hang at your girdle
 All thoughtme beautiful: people who never did so before
 I wanted to say to them,"Am I not beautiful? I am, am I not?" And it was not for myself I wasasking this praise
 Beloved, I was wearing the magic rose--what you gaveme when we parted: you saying, alas, that you were not to be there
 Butyou _were_! Its leaves have not dropped nor the scent of it faded
 Ikiss you out of the heart of it
 Good-night: come to me in my firstdream!LETTER XII
Dearest: It has been such a funny day from post-time onwards:--congratulations on the great event are beginning to arrive in envelopesand on wheels
 Some are very kind and dear; and some are not so--only theordinary seemliness of polite sniffle-snaffle
 Just after you had goneyesterday, Mrs
 ---- called and was told the news
 Of course she knew _of_you: but didn't think she had ever seen you
 "Probably he passed you atthe gates," I said
 "What?" she went off with a view-hallo; "thatwell-dressed sort of young fellow in gray, and a mustache, and knowing howto ride? Met us in the lane
 _Well_, my dear, I _do_ congratulate you!"And whether it was by the gray suit, or the mustache, or the knowing howto ride that her congratulations were so emphatically secured, I know not!Others are yet more quaint, and more to my liking
 Nan-nan is Nan-nan: Icannot let you off what she said! No tears or sentiment came from herto prevent me laughing: she brisked like an old war-horse at the firstword of it, and blessed God that it had come betimes, that she might bea nurse again in her old age! She is a true "Mrs
 Berry," and is readyto make room for you in my affections for the sake of far-off divineevents, which promise renewed youth to her old bones
Roberts, when he brought me my pony this morning, touched his hat quicktwice over to show that the news brimmed in his body: and a very nicecordial way of showing, I thought it! He was quite ready to talk when Ilet him go; and he gave me plenty of good fun
 He used to know you whenhe was in service at the H----s, and speaks of you as being then "agallous young hound," whatever that may mean
 I imagine "gallous" to bea rustic Lewis Carroll compound, made up in equal parts of callousnessand gallantry, which most boys are, at some stage of their existence
What tales will you be getting of me out of Nan-nan, some day behind myback, I wonder? There is one I shall forbid her to reveal: it shall bepart of my marriage-portion to show you early that you have got a wifewith a temper!Here is a whole letter that must end now,--and the great Word nevermentioned! It is good for you to be put upon _maigre_ fare, for once
 Iho_l_d my pen back with b_o_th hands: it wants so much to gi_v_e youthe forbidd_e_n treat
 Oh, the serpent in the garden! See where it hasunderlined its meaning
 Frailty, thy pen is a J pen!Adieu, adieu, remember me
LETTER XIII
The letters? No, Beloved, I could not! Not yet
 There you have caught mewhere I own I am still shy of you
A long time hence, when we are a safely wedded pair, you shall turn themover
 It _may_ be a short time; but I will keep them however long
 IndeedI must ever keep them; they talk to me of the dawn of my existence,--theearly light before our sun rose, when my love of you was growing and hadnot yet reached its full
If I disappoint you I will try to make up for it with something I wrotelong before I ever saw you
 To-day I was turning over old things my motherhad treasured for me of my childhood--of days spent with her: things oflaughter as well as of tears; such a dear selection, so quaint and sweet,with moods of her as I dimly remember her to have been
 And among them wasthis absurdity, written, and I suppose placed in the mouth of my stocking,the Christmas I stayed with her in France
 I remember the time as a greattreat, but nothing of this
 "Nilgoes" is "Nicholas," you must understand!How he must have laughed over me asleep while he read this!     "Cher père Nilgoes
 S'il vous plait voulez vous me donné     plus de jeux que des oranges des pommes et des pombons parc     que nous allons faire l'arbre de noel cette anné et les     jeaux ferait mieux pour l'arbre de Noel

     Adieu cher St
 Nilgoes
"I haven't altered the spelling, I love it too well, prophetic of a faultI still carry about me
 How strange that little bit of invocation to thedear folk above sounds to me now! My mother must have been teaching methings after her own persuasion; most naturally, poor dear one--thoughthat too has gone like water off my mind
 It was one of the troublesbetween her and my father: the compact that I was to be brought up aCatholic was dissolved after they separated; and I am sorry, thinking itunjust to her; yet glad, content with being what I am
I must have been less than five when I penned this: I was always aletter-writer, it seems
It is a reproach now from many that I have ceased to be: and to them Ifear it is true
 That I have not truly ceased, "witness under my handthese presents,"--or whatever may be the proper legal terms for anaffidavit
What were _you_ like, Beloved, as a very small child? Should I have lovedyou from the beginning had we toddled to the rencounter; and would my lovehave passed safely through the "gallous young hound" period; and could Ilove you more now in any case, had I _all_ your days treasured up in myheart, instead of less than a year of them?How strangely much have seven miles kept our fates apart! It seemsuncharacteristic for this small world,--where meetings come about so farabove the dreams of average--to have played us such a prank
This must do for this once, Beloved; for behold me busy to-day: with_what_, I shall not tell you
 I would like to put you to a test, asladies did their knights of old, and hardly ever do now--fearing, Isuppose, lest the species should altogether fail them at the pinch
 Iwould like to see if you could come here and sit with me from beginningto end, _with your eyes shut_: never once opening them
 I am not sayingwhether I think curiosity, or affection, would make the attempt toodifficult
 But if you were sure you could, you might come hereto-morrow--a day otherwise interdicted
 Only know, having come, that ifyou open those dear cupboards of vision and set eyes on things not yetintended to be looked at, there will be confusion of tongues in thisTower we are building whose top is to reach heaven
 Will you come? Idon't _say_ "come"; I only want to know--will you?To-day my love flies low over the earth like a swallow before rain, andtouching the tops of the flowers has culled you these
 Kiss them untilthey open: they are full of my thoughts, as the world, to me, is full ofyou
LETTER XIV
Own Dearest: Come I did not think that you would, or mean that you shouldseriously; for is it not a poor way of love to make the object of it cutan absurd or partly absurd figure? I wrote only as a woman having a secreton the tip of her tongue and the tips of her fingers, and full of alonging to say it and send it
Here it is at last: love me for it, I have worked so hard to get it done!And you do not know why and what for? Beloved, it--_this_--is theanniversary of the day we first met; and you have forgotten it already ornever remembered it:--and yet have been clamoring for "the letters"!On the first anniversary of our marriage, _if you remember it_, you shallhave those same letters: and not otherwise
 So there they lie safe tilldoomsday!The M
-A
 has been very gracious and clear after her little outbreak ofyesterday: her repentances, after I have hurt her feelings, are so gentleand sweet, they always fill me with compunction
 Finding that I would goon with the thing I was doing, she volunteered to come and read to me: arequiem over the bone of contention which we had gnawed between us
 Wasnot that pretty and charitable? She read Tennyson's Life for a solidhour, and continued it to-day
 Isn't it funny that she should take up sucha book?--she who "can't abide" Tennyson or Browning or Shakespeare: onlylikes Byron, I suppose because it was the right and fashionable likingwhen she was young
 Yet she is plodding through the Life religiously--onlyskipping the verses
 I have come across two little specimens of "Death andthe child" in it
 His son, Lionel, was carried out in a blanket one nightin the great comet year, and waking up under the stars asked, "Am I dead?"Number two is of a little girl at Wellington's funeral who saw his chargercarrying his _boots_, and asked, "Shall I be like that after I die?"A queer old lady came to lunch yesterday, a great traveler, though lameon two crutches
 We carefully hid all guide-books and maps, and held ourpeace about next month, lest she should insist on coming too: though Ithink Nineveh was the place she was most anxious to go to, if the M
-A
would consent to accompany her!Good-by, dearest of one-year-old acquaintances! you, too, send yourblessing on the anniversary, now that my better memory has reminded youof it! All that follow we will bless in company
 I trust you areone-half as happy as I am, my own, my own
LETTER XV
You told me, dearest, that I should find your mother formidable
 It istrue; I did
 She is a person very much in the grand pagan style: I admireit, but I cannot flow in that sort of company, and I think she meant tocrush me
 You were very wise to leave her to come alone
I like her: I mean I believe that under that terribleness she has aheart of gold, which once opened would never shut: but she has notopened it to me
 I believe she could have a great charity, that noevil-doing would dismay her: "stanch" sums her up
 But I have donenothing wrong enough yet to bring me into her good graces
 Loving herson, even, though, I fear, a great offense, has done me no good turn
Perhaps that is her inconsistency: women are sure to be inconsistentsomewhere: it is their birthright
I began to study her at once, to find _you_: it did not take long
 How Icould love her, if she would let me!You know her far far better than I, and want no advice: otherwise Iwould say--never praise me to her; quote my follies rather! To giveground for her distaste to revel in will not deepen me in her bad booksso much as attempts to warp her judgment
I need not go through it all: she will have told you all that is to thepurpose about our meeting
 She bristled in, a brave old fighting figure,announcing compulsion in every line, but with all her colors flying
 Shewaited for the door to close, then said, "My son has bidden me come, Isuppose it is my duty: he is his own master now
"We only shook hands
 Our talk was very little of you
 I showed her all thehorses, the dogs, and the poultry; she let the inspection appear toconclude with myself: asked me my habits, and said I looked healthy
 Iowned I felt it
 "Looks and feelings are the most deceptive things in theworld," she told me; adding that "poor stock" got more than its share ofthese
 And when she said it I saw quite plainly that she meant me
I wonder where she gets the notion: for we are a long-lived race, bothsides of the family
 I guessed that she would like frankness, and was asfrank as I could be, pretending no deference to her objections
 "Youthink you suit each other?" she asked me
 My answer, "He suits me!"pleased her maternal palate, I think
 "Any girl might say that!" sheadmitted
 (She might indeed!)This is the part of our interview she will not have repeated to you
I was due at Hillyn when she was preparing to go: Aunt N---- came in,and I left her to do the honors while I slipped on my habit
 I rode byyour mother's carriage as far as the Greenway, where we branched
 Isuppose that is what her phrase means that you quote about my "making atrophy of her," and marching her a prisoner across the borders beforeall the world!I do like her: she is worth winning
--Can one say warmer of a futuremother-in-law who stands hostile?All the same it was an ordeal
 I believe I have wept since: for Benjyscratched my door often yesterday evening, and looked most wistful whenI came out
 Merely paltry self-love, dearest:--I am so little accustomedto not being--liked
I think she will be more gracious in her own house
 I have her formalword that I am to come
 Soon, not too soon, I will come over; and youshall meet me and take me to see her
 There is something in heropposition that I can't fathom: I wondered twice was lunacy her notion:she looked at me so hard
My mother's seclusion and living apart from us was not on _that_account
 I often saw her: she was very dear and sweet to me, and hadquiet eyes the very reverse of a person mentally deranged
 My father, Iknow, went to visit her when she lay dying; and I remember we all woremourning
 My uncle has told me they had a deep regard for each other:but disagreed, and were independent enough to choose living apart
I do not remember my father ever speaking of her to us as children: butI am sure there was no state of health to be concealed
Last night I was talking to Aunt N---- about her
 "A very dear woman,"she told me, "but your father was never so much alive to her worth asthe rest of us
" Of him she said, "A dear, fine fellow: but not at alleasy to get on with
" Him, of course, I have a continuous recollectionof, and "a fine fellow" we did think him
 My mother comes to me morerarely, at intervals
Don't talk me down your mother's throat: but tell her as much as she caresto know of this
 I am very proud of my "stock" which she thinks "poor"!Dear, how much I have written on things which can never concern usfinally, and so should not ruffle us while they last! Hold me in yourheart always, always; and the world may turn adamant to me for aught Icare! Be in my dreams to-night!LETTER XVI
But, Dearest: When I think of you I never question whether what I thinkwould be true or false in the eyes of others
 All that concerns you seemsto go on a different plane where evidence has no meaning or existence:where nobody exists or means anything, but only we two alone, engaged inbringing about for ourselves the still greater solitude of two into one
Oh, Beloved, what a company that will be! Take me in your arms, fasten meto your heart, breathe on me
 Deny me either breath or the light of day: Iam yours equally, to live or die at your word
 I shut my eyes to feel yourkisses falling on me like rain, or still more like sunshine,--yet most ofall like kisses, my own dearest and best beloved!Oh, we two! how wonderful we seem! And to think that there have beenlovers like us since the world began: and the world not able to tell usone little word of it:--not well, so as to be believed--or only alongwith sadness where Fate has broken up the heavens which lay over somepair of lovers
 Oenone's cry, "Ah me, my mountain shepherd," tells usof the joy when it has vanished, and most of all I get it in that songof wife and husband which ends:--    "Not a word for you,       Not a lock or kiss,         Good-by
     We, one, must part in two;       Verily death is this:         I must die
"It was a woman wrote that: and we get love there! Is it only when joy ispast that we can give it its full expression? Even now, Beloved, I breakdown in trying to say how I love you
 I cannot put all my joy into mywords, nor all my love into my lips, nor all my life into your arms,whatever way I try
 Something remains that I cannot express
 Believe,dearest, that the half has not yet been spoken, neither of my love foryou, nor of my trust in you,--nor of a wish that seems sad, but comes in avery tumult of happiness--the wish to die so that some unknown good maycome to you out of me
Not till you die, dearest, shall I die truly! I love you now too much foryour heart not to carry me to its grave, though I should die now, and youlive to be a hundred
 I pray you may! I cannot choose a day for you todie
 I am too grateful to life which has given me to you to say--if Iwere dying--"Come with me, dearest!" Though, how the words tempt me as Iwrite them!--Come with me, dearest: yes, come! Ah, but you kiss me more, Ithink, when we say good-by than when meeting; so you will kiss me most ofall when I have to die:--a thing in death to look forward to! And, tillthen,--life, life, till I am out of my depth in happiness and drown inyour arms!Beloved, that I can write so to you,--think what it means; what you havemade me come through in the way of love, that this, which I could not havedreamed before, comes from me with the thought of you! You told me to bestill--to let you "worship": I was to write back acceptance of all yourdear words
 Are you never to be at my feet, you ask
 Indeed, dearest, I donot know how, for I cannot move from where I am! Do you feel where mythoughts kiss you? You would be vexed with me if I wrote it down, so I donot
 And after all, some day, under a bright star of Providence, I mayhave gifts for you after my own mind which will allow me to grow proud
Only now all the giving comes from you
 It is I who am enriched by yourlove, beyond knowledge of my former self
 Are _you_ changed, dearest, byanything I have done?My heart goes to you like a tree in the wind, and all these thoughts areloose leaves that fly after you when I have to remain behind
 Dear lover,what short visits yours seem! and the Mother-Aunt tells me they are mostunconscionably long
--You will not pay any attention to _that_, please:forever let the heavens fall rather than that a hint to such foul effectshould grow operative through me!This brings you me so far as it can:--such little words off so great abody of--"liking" shall I call it? My paper stops me: it is my last sheet:I should have to go down to the library to get more--else I think I couldnot cease writing
More love than I can name
--Ever, dearest, your own
LETTER XVII
Dearest: Do I not write you long letters? It reveals my weakness
 I havethought (it had been coming on me, and now and then had broken out of mebefore I met you) that, left to myself, I should have become a writer ofbooks--I scarcely can guess what sort--and gone contentedly intomiddle-age with that instead of _this_ as my _raison d'être_
How gladly I lay down that part of myself, and say--"But for you, I hadbeen this quite other person, whom I have no wish to be now"! Beloved,your heart is the shelf where I put all my uncut volumes, wondering alittle what sort of a writer I should have made; and chiefly wondering,would _you_ have liked me in that character?There is one here in the family who considers me a writer of the darkestdye, and does not approve of it
 Benjy comes and sits most mournfullyfacing me when I settle down on a sunny morning, such as this, to write:and inquires, with all the dumbness a dog is capable of--"What has comebetween us, that you fill up your time and mine with those cat's-clawscratchings, when you should be in your woodland dress running [with] methrough damp places?"Having written this sentimental meaning into his eyes, and Benjy stillsitting watching me, I was seized with ruth for my neglect of him, andtook him to see his mother's grave
 At the bottom of the long walk is ourdog's cemetery:--no tombstones, but mounds; and a dog-rose grows there andflourishes as nowhere else
 It was my fancy as a child to have it planted:and I declare to you, it has taken wonderfully to the notion, as if it_knew_ that it had relations of a higher species under its keeping
 Benjy,too, has a profound air of knowing, and never scratches for bones there,as he does in other places
 What horror, were I to find him digging up hismother's skeleton! Would my esteem for him survive?When we got there to-day, he deprecated my choice of locality, askingwhat I had brought him _there_ for
 I pointed out to him the precisemound which covered the object of his earliest affections, and gatheredyou these buds
 Are they not a deep color for wild ones?--if their blushremains a fixed state till the post brings them to you
Through what flower would you best like to be passed back, as regardsyour material atoms, into the spiritualized side of nature, when wehave done with ourselves in this life? No single flower quite covers allmy wants and aspirations
 You and I would put our heads togetherunderground and evolve a new flower--"carnation, lily, lily, rose"--andsend it up one fine morning for scientists to dispute over and givediabolical learned names to
 What an end to our cozy floralcollaboration that would be!Here endeth the epistle: the elect salutes you
 This week, if theauthorities permit, I shall be paying you a flying visit, with wingsfull of eyes,--_and_, I hope, healing; for I believe you are seedy, andthat _that_ is what is behind it
 You notice I have not complained
Dearest, how could I! My happiness reaches to the clouds--that is, towhere things are not quite clear at present
 I love you no more than Iought: yet far more than I can name
 Good-night and good-morning
--Yourstar, since you call me so
LETTER XVIII
Dearest: Not having had a letter from you this morning, I have read oversome back ones, and find in one a bidding which I have never fulfilled, totell you what I _do_ all day
 Was that to avoid the too great length of mytelling you what I _think_? Yet you get more of me this way than that
What I do is every day so much the same: while what I think is alwaysdifferent
 However, since you want a woman of action rather than of brain,here I start telling you
I wake punctual and hungry at the sound of Nan-nan's drawing of theblinds: wait till she is gone (the old darling potters and tattles: itis her most possessive moment of me in the day, except when I shamheadaches, and let her put me to bed); then I have my hand under mypillow and draw out your last for a reading that has lost count whetherit is the twenty-second or the fifty-second time;--discover new beautiesin it, and run to the glass to discover new beauties in myself,--findthem; Benjy comes up with the post's latest, and behold, my day isbegun!Is that the sort of thing you want to know? My days are without anaction worth naming: I only think swelling thoughts, and write some ofthem: if ever I do anything worth telling, be sure I run a pen-and-inkrace to tell you
 No, it is man who _does_ things; a woman only diddles(to adapt a word of diminutive sound for the occasion), unless, good,fortunate, independent thing, she works for her own living: and that isnot me!I feel sometimes as if a real bar were between me and a whole conceptionof life; because I have carpets and curtains, and Nan-nan, and Benjy,and last of all you--shutting me out from the realities of existence
If you would all leave me just for one full moon, and come back to meonly when I am starving for you all--for my tea to be brought to me inthe morning, and all the paddings and cushionings which bolster me upfrom morning till night--with what a sigh of wisdom I would drop backinto your arms, and would let you draw the rose-colored curtains roundme again!Now I am afraid lest I have become too happy: I am leaning so far out ofwindow to welcome the dawn, I seem to be tempting a fall--heaven itselfto fall upon me
What do I _know_ truly, who only know so much happiness?Dearest, if there is anything else in love which I do not know, teach itme quickly: I am utterly yours
 If there is sorrow to give, give it me!Only let me have with it the consciousness of your love
Oh, my dear, I lose myself if I think of you so much
 What would lifehave without you in it? The sun would drop from my heavens
 I see onlyby you! you have kissed me on the eyes
 You are more to me than my ownpoor brain could ever have devised: had I started to invent Paradise, Icould not have invented _you_
 But perhaps you have invented me: I amsomething new to myself since I saw you first
 God bless you for it!Even if you were to shut your eyes at me now--though I might go blind,you could not unmake me:--"The gods themselves cannot recall theirgifts
" Also that I am yours is a gift of the gods, I will trust: andso, not to be recalled!Kiss me, dearest; here where I have written this! I am yours, Beloved
 Ikiss you again and again
--Ever your own making
LETTER XIX
Dearest, Dearest: How long has this happened? You don't tell me the day orthe hour
 Is it ever since you last wrote? Then you have been in pain andgrief for four days: and I not knowing anything about it! And you have nohand in the house kind enough to let you dictate by it one small word topoor me? What heartless merrymakings may I not have sent you to worry you,when soothing was the one thing wanted? Well, I will not worry now, then;neither at not being told, nor at not being allowed to come: but I willcome thus and thus, O my dear heart, and take you in my arms
 And you willbe comforted, will you not be? when I tell you that even if you had nolegs at all, I would love you just the same
 Indeed, dearest, so much ofyou is a superfluity: just your heart against mine, and the sound of yourvoice, would carry me up to more heavens than I could otherwise havedreamed of
 I may say now, now that I know it was not your choice, what avoid these last few days the lack of letters has been to me
 I wondered,truly, if you had found it well to put off such visible signs for a whilein order to appease one who, in other things more essential, sees yourebellious
 But the wonder is over now; and I don't want you to write--nottill a consultation of doctors orders it for the good of your health
 Iwill be so happy talking to you: also I am sending you books:--those Iwish you to read; and which now you _must_, since you have the leisure!And I for my part will make time and read yours
 Whose do you most want meto read, that my education in your likings may become complete? What Isend you will not deprive me of anything: for I have the beautifulcomplete set--your gift--and shall read side by side with you to realizein imagination what the happiness of reading them for the first time oughtto be
Yesterday, by a most unsympathetic instinct, I went out for a long trampon my two feet; and no ache in them came and told me of you! OverSillingford I sat on a bank and looked downhill where went a carter
 AndI looked uphill where lay something which might be nothing--or not his
Now, shall I make a fool of myself by pursuing to tell him he may havedropped something, or shall I go on and see? So I went on and saw a coatwith a fat pocket: and by then he was out of sight, and perhaps itwasn't his; and it was very hot and the hill steep
 So I minded my ownbusiness, making Cain's motto mine; and now feel so had, being quitesure that it was his
 And I wonder how many miles he will have trampedback looking for it, and whether his dinner was in the pocket
These unintentional misdoings are the "sins" one repents of all one'slife long: I have others stored away, the bitterest of small things doneor undone in haste and repented of at so much leisure afterwards
 Andalways done to people or things I had no grudge against, sometimes evena love for
 They are my skeletons: I will tell you of them some day
This, dearest, is our first enforced absence from each other; and I feelit almost more hard on me than on you
 Beloved, let us lay our heartstogether and get comforted
 It is not real separation to know thatanother part of the world contains the rest of me
 Oh, the rest of me,the rest of me that you are! So, thinking of you, I can never be tired
I rest yours
LETTER XX
Yes, Dearest, "Patience!" but it is a virtue I have little enough ofnaturally, and used to be taught to pray for as a child
 And I rememberonce really hurting clear Mother-Aunt's feelings by trying to repay herfor that teaching by a little iniquitous laughter at her expense
 It wastoo funny for me to feel very contrite about, as I do sometimes over quitesmall things, or I would not be telling it you now (for there are thingsin me I would conceal even from you)
 I dare say you wouldn't guess it,but the M
-A
 is a most long person over her private devotions
 Perhaps itwas her own habit, with the cares of a household sometimes conflicting,which made her recite to me so often her pet legend of a saintly personwho, constantly interrupted over her prayers by mundane matters, became apattern in patience out of these snippings of her godly desires
 So, oneday, angels in the disguise of cross people with selfish demands on hertime came seeking to know where in her composition or composureexasperation began: and finding none, they let her return in peace to hermissal, where for a reward all the letters had been turned into gold
 "Andthat, my dear, comes of patience," my aunt would say, till I grew a littletired of the saying
 I don't know what experience my uncle had gathered ofher patience under like circumstances: but I notice that to this day hetreads delicately, like Agag, when he knows her to be on her knees; andprefers then to send me on his errands instead of doing them himself
So it happened one day that he wanted a particular coat which had been putaway in her clothes-closet--and she was on her knees between him and it,with the time of her Amen quite indefinite
 I was sent, said my errandbriefly, and was permitted to fumble out her keys from her pocket whileshe continued to kneel over her morning psalms
What I brought to him turned out to be the wrong coat: I went back andknocked for readmittance
 Long-sufferingly she bade me to come in
 Iexplained, and still she repressed herself, only saying in a tone ofaffliction, "Do see this time that you take the right one!"After I had made my second selection, and proved it right on my uncle'sperson, the parallelism of things struck me, and I skipped back to myaunt's door and tapped
 I got a low wailing "Yes?" for answer--amonosyllabic substitute for the "How long, O Lord?" of a saint indifficulties
 When I called through the keyhole, "Are your psalmswritten in gold?" she became really angry:--I suppose because themiracle so well earned had not come to pass
Well, dearest, if you have been patient with me over so much aboutnothing, I pray this letter may appear to you written in gold
 Why Iwrite so is, partly, that, it is bad for us both to be down in themouth, or with hearts down at heel: and so, since you cannot, I have todo the dancing;--and, partly, because I found I had a bad temper on mewhich needed curing, and being brought to the sun-go-down point of owingno man anything
 Which, sooner said, has finally been done; and I amvery meek now and loving to you, and everything belonging to you--not tocome nearer the sore point
And I hope some day, some day, as a reward to my present submission,that you will sprain your ankle in my company (just a very little bitfor an excuse) and let me have the nursing of it! It hurts my heart tohave your poor bones crying out for comfort that I am not to bring tothem
 I feel robbed of a part of my domestic training, and may neverpick up what I have just lost
 And I fear greatly you must have beentruly in pain to have put off Meredith for a day
 If I had been at handto read to you, I flatter myself you would have liked him well, andbeen soothed
 You must take the will, Beloved, for the deed
 I kiss younow, as much as even you can demand; and when you get this I will bethinking of you all over again
--When do I ever leave off? Love, love,love till our next meeting-, and then more love still, and more!--Everyour own
LETTER XXI
Dearest: I am in a simple mood to-day, and give you the benefit of it:I shall become complicated again presently, and you will hear from medirectly that happens
The house only emptied itself this morning; I may say emptied, for theremainder fits like a saint into her niche, and is far too comfortableto count
 This is C----, whom you only once met, when she sat so much inthe background that you will not remember her
 She has one weakness, athirst between meals--the blameless thirst of a rabid teetotaler
 Shehides cups of cold tea about the place, as a dog its bones: now and thenone gets spilled or sat on, and when she hears of the accident, shelooks thirsty, with a thirst which only _that_ particular cup of teacould have quenched
 In no other way is she any trouble: indeed, she isa great dear, and has the face of a Madonna, as beautiful as anapocryphal gospel to look at and "make believe" in
Arthur, too, like the rest of them, when he came over to give me hisbrotherly blessing, wished to know what you were like
 I didn't pretendto remember your outward appearance too well,--told him you looked likea common or garden Englishman, and roused his suspicions by so carelessa championship of my choice
 He accused me of being in reality highlysentimental about you, and with having at that moment your portraitconcealed and strung around my neck in a locket
 Mother-Aunt stood upfor me against him, declaring I was "too sensible a girl for nonsense ofthat sort
" (It is a little weakness of hers, you know, to resentextremes of endearment towards anyone but herself in those she has"brooded," and she has thought us hitherto most restrained andproper--as, indeed, have we not been?) Arthur and I exchanged tokens oftruce: in a little while off went my aunt to bed, leaving us alone
Then, for he is the one of us that I am most frank with: "Arthur," criedI, and up came your little locket like a bucket from a well, for him tohave his first sight of you, my Beloved
 He objected that he could notsee faces in a nutshell; and I suppose others cannot: only I
He, too, is gone
 If you had been coming he would have spared anotherday--for to-day _was_ planned and dated, you will remember--and we wouldhave ridden halfway to meet you
 But, as fate has tripped you, and madeall comings on your part indefinite, he sends you his hopes for a latermeeting
How is your poor foot? I suppose, as it is ill, I may send it a kiss bypost and wish it well? I do
 Truly, you are to let me know if it givesyou much pain, and I will lie awake thinking of you
 This is notsentimental, for if one knows that a friend is occupied over one'ssleeplessness one feels the comfort
I am perplexed how else to give you my company: your mother, I know,could not yet truly welcome me; and I wish to be as patient as possible,and not push for favors that are not offered
 So I cannot come and askto take you out in _her_ carriage, nor come and carry you away in mine
We must try how fast we can hold hands at a distance
I have kept up to where you have been reading in "Richard Feverel,"though it has been a scramble: for I have less opportunity of reading, Iwith my feet, than you without yours
 In _your_ book I have just got tothe smuggling away of General Monk in the perforated coffin, and mysense of history capitulates in an abandonment of laughter
 I yield! TheGaul's invasion of Britain always becomes broad farce when he attemptsit
 This in clever ludicrousness beats the unintentional comedy ofVictor Hugo's "John-Jim-Jack" as a name typical of Anglo-Saxonchristenings
 But Dumas, through a dozen absurdities, knows apparentlyhow to stalk his quarry: so large a genius may play the fool and remainwise
You see I have given your author a warm welcome at last: and what aboutyou and mine? Tell me you love his women and I will not be jealous
Indeed, outside him I don't know where to find a written English womanof modern times whom I would care to meet, or could feel honestly boundto look up to:--nowhere will I have her shaking her ringlets at me inDickens or Thackeray
 Scott is simply not modern; and Hardy's women, ifthey have nobility in them, get so cruelly broken on the wheel that youget but the wrecks of them at last
 It is only his charming baggages whocome to a good ending
I like an author who has the courage and self-restraint to leave his noblecreations alive: too many try to ennoble them by death
 For my part, if Ihave to go out of life before you, I would gladly trust you to the handsof Clara, or Rose, or Janet, or most of all Vittoria; though, to beaccurate, I fear they have all grown too old for you by now
And you? have you any men to offer me in turn out of your literaryadmirations, supposing you should die of a snapped ankle? Would you giveme to d'Artagnan for instance? Hardly, I suspect! But either choose mesome proxy hero, or get well and come to me! You will be very welcomewhen you do
 Sleep is making sandy eyes at me: good-night, dearest
LETTER XXII
Why, my Beloved: Since you put it to me as a point of conscience (it isonly lying on your back with one active leg doing nothing, and the otherdying to have done aching, which has made you take this new start ofinquiring within upon everything), since you call on me for aconscientious answer, I say that it stands to reason that I love you morethan you love me, because there is so much more of you to love, let alonefit for loving
Do you imagine that you are going to be a cripple for life, and thereforean indifferent dancer in the dances I shall always be leading you, thatyou have started this fit of self-depreciation? Or is it because I havethrown Meredith at your sick head that you doubt my tact and my affection,and my power patiently to bear for your sake a good deal of cold shoulder?Dearest, remember I am doctoring you from a distance: and am not yetallowed to come and see my patient, so can only judge from your lettershow ill you are
 That you have been concealing from me almosttreacherously: and only by a piece of abject waylaying did I receive wordto-day of your sleepless nights, and so get the key to your symptoms
 Layby Meredith, then, for a while: I am sending you a cargo of Stevensoninstead
 You have been truly unkind, trying to read what required effort,when you were fit for nothing of the sort
And lest even Stevenson should be too much for you, and wanting very much,and perhaps a little bit jealously, to be your most successful nurse, I amletting my last large bit of shyness of you go; and with a pleasant sortof pain, because I know I have hit on a thing that will please you, I openmy hands and let you have these, and with them goes my last blush:henceforth I am a woman without a secret, and all your interest in me mayevaporate
 Yet I know well it will not
As for this resurrection pie from love's dead-letter office, you willfind from it at least one thing--how much I depended upon response fromyou before I could become at all articulate
 It is you, dearest, fromthe beginning who have set my head and heart free and made me a woman
 Iam something quite different from the sort of child I was less than ayear ago when I wrote that small prayer which stands sponsor for allthat follows
 How abundantly it has been answered, dearest Beloved,only I know: you do not!Now my prayer is not that you should "come true," but that you shouldget well
 Do this one little thing for me, dearest! For you I will doanything: my happiness waits for that
 As yet I seem to have donenothing
 Oh, but, Beloved, I will! From a reading of the Fioretti, Isign myself as I feel
--Your glorious poor little one

Dear Prince Wonderful: Now that I have met you I pray that you will be myfriend
 I want just a little of your friendship, but that, so much, somuch! And even for that little I do not know how to ask
Always to be _your_ friend: of that you shall be quite sure
C
Dear Prince Wonderful: Long ago when I was still a child I told myselfof you: but thought of you only as in a fairy tale
 Now I am afraid oftrusting my eyes or ears, for fear I should think too much of you beforeI know you really to be true
 Do not make me wish so much to be yourfriend, unless you are also going to be true!Please come true now, for mine and for all the world's sake:--but formine especially, because I thought of you first! And if you are not ableto come true, don't make me see you any more
 I shall always rememberyou, and be glad that I have seen you just once
D
Dear Prince Wonderful: _Has_ God blessed you yet and made you come true? Ihave not seen you again, so how am I to know? Not that it is necessary forme to know even if you do come true
 I believe already that you are true
If I were never to see you again I should be glad to think of you asliving, and shall always be your friend
 I pray that you may come toknow that

Dear Highness: I do not know what to write to you: I only know how much Iwish to write
 I have always written the things I thought about: it hasbeen easy to find words for them
 Now I think about you, but have nowords:--no words, dear Highness, for you! I could write at once if I knewyou were my friend
 Come true for me: I will have so much to tell youthen!F
Dear Highness: If I believe in fairy tales coming true, it is because I amsuperstitious
 This is what I did to-day
 I shut my eyes and took a bookfrom the shelf, opened it, and put my fingers down on a page
 This is whatI came to:    "All I believed is true!       I am able yet       All I want to get     By a method as strange as new:     Dare I trust the same to you?"Fate says, then, you are to be my friend
 Fate has said I am yoursalready
 That is very certain
 Only in real life where things come truewould a book have opened as this has done
G
Dear Highness: I am sure now, then, that I please you, and that you likeme, perhaps only a little: for you turned out of your way to ride with methough you were going somewhere so fast
 How much I wished it when I sawyou coming, but dared not believe it would come true!"Come true": it is the word I have always been writing, and everything_has_:--you most of all! You are more true each time I see you
 So truethat now I will write it down at last,--the truth for you who have comeso true
Dear Highness and Great Heart, I love you dearly, though you don't knowit,--quite ever so much; and am going to love you ever so much more,only--please like _me_ a little better first! You on your dear side mustdo something: or, before I know, I may be wringing my hands all alone ona desert island to a bare blue horizon, with nothing in it real orfabulous
If I am to love you, nothing but happiness is to be allowed to come ofit
 So don't come true too fast without one little wee correspondingwish for me to find that you are! I am quite happy thinking you outslowly: it takes me all day long; the longer the better!I wonder how often in my life I shall write down that I love you, havingonce written it (I do:--I love you! there [it] is for you, with more tofollow after!); and send you my love as I do now into the greatemptiness of chance, hoping somehow, known or unknown, it may bless youand bring good to you
Oh, but 'tis a windy world, and I a mere feather in it: how can I getblown the way I would?Still I have a superstition that some star is over me which I have notseen yet, but shall,--Heaven helping me
And now good-night, and no more, no more at all! I send out an "I loveyou" to be my celestial commercial traveler for me while I fold myselfup and become its sleeping partner
Good-night: you are the best and truest that I ever dreamed yet
H
Dear Highness: I begin not to be able to name you anything, for there isnot a word for you that will do! "Highness" you are: but that leaves gapsand coldnesses without end
 "Royal," yet much more serene than royal:though by that I don't mean any detraction from your royalty, for I neversaw a man carry his invisible crown with so level a head and nohaughtiness at all: and that is the finest royalty of look possible
I look at you and wonder so how you have grown to this--to have becomeking so quietly without any coronation ceremony
 You have thought morethan you should for happiness at your age; making me, by that one linein your forehead, think you were three years older than you really are
I wish--if I dare wish you anything different--that you were! It makesme uncomfortable to remember that I am--what? Almost half a year yourelder as time flies:--not really, for your brain was born long beforemine began to rattle in its shell
 You say quite _old_ things, andquietly, as if you had had them in your mind ten years already
 When youtold me about your two old pensioners, the blind man and his wife, whomyou brought to so funny a reconciliation, I felt ("mir war, ich wusztenicht wie") that I would like very much to go blindfold led by you: itstruck me suddenly how happy would be a blindfoldness of perfect trustsuch as one might have with your hands on one
 I suppose that is what inreligion is called faith: I haven't it there, my dear; but I have it inyou now
 I love you, beginning to understand why: at first I did not
 Iam ashamed not to have discovered it earlier
 The matter with you isthat you have goodness prevailing in you, an integrity of goodness, Imean:--a different thing from there being a whereabouts for goodness inyou; _that_ we all have in some proportion or another
 I was quite rightto love you: I know it now,--I did not when I first did
Yesterday I was turning over a silly "confession book" in which a rose waseverybody's favorite flower, manliness the finest quality for a man, andwomanliness for a woman (which is as much as to say that pig is the bestquality for pork, and pork for pig): till I came upon one different fromthe others, and found myself saying "Yes" all down the page
I turned over for the signature, and found my own mother's
 Was it not astrange sweet meeting? And only then did the memory of her handwritingfrom far back come to me
 She died, dear Highness, before I was sevenyears old
 I love her as I do my early memory of flowers, as somethingvery sweet, hardly as a real person
I noticed she loved best in men and women what they lack most often: in aman, a fair mind; in a woman, courage
 "Brave women and fair men," shewrote
 Byron might have turned in his grave at having his dissolutestiff-neck so wrung for him by misquotation
 And she--it must have beenbefore the eighties had started the popular craze for him--chose Meredith,my own dear Meredith, for her favorite author
 How our tastes would haverun together had she lived!Well, I know you fair, and believe myself brave--constitutionally, sothat I can't help it: and this, therefore, is not self-praise
 Butfairness in a man is a deadly hard acquirement, I begin now to discover
You have it fixed fast in you
You, I think, began to do just things consciously, as the burden ofmanhood began in you
 I love to think of you growing by degrees till youcould carry your head _so_--and no other way; so that, looking at you, Ican promise myself you never did a mean thing, and never consciously anunjust thing except to yourself
 I can just fancy that fault in you
But, whatever--I love you for it more and more, and am proud knowing youand finding that we are to become friends
 For it is that, and no lessthan that, now
I love you; and me you like cordially: and that is enough
 I need notlook behind it, for already I have no way to repay you for the happinessthis brings me
I
Oh, I think greatly of you, my dear; and it takes long thinking
 Notmerely such a quantity of thought, but such a quality, makes so hard aday's work that by the end of it I am quite drowsy
 Bless me, dearest; allto-day has belonged to you; and to-morrow, I know, waits to become yourswithout the asking: just as without the asking I too am yours
 I wish itwere more possible for us to give service to those we love
 I am most gladbecause I see you so often: but I come and go in your life empty-handed,though I have so much to give away
 Thoughts, the best I have, I give you:I cannot empty my brain of them
 Some day you shall think well of me
--Thatis a vow, dear friend,--you whom I love so much!J
I have not had to alter any thought ever formed about you, Beloved; I haveonly had to deepen it--that is all
 You grow, but you remain
 I have heardpeople talk about you, generally kindly; but what they think of you isoften wrong
 I do not say anything, but I am glad, and so sure that I knowyou better
 If my mind is so clear about you, it shows that you are goodfor me
 Now for nearly three months I may not see you again; but all thattime you will be growing in my heart; and at the end without another wordfrom you I shall find that I know you better than before
 Is that strange?It is because I love you: love is knowledge--blind knowledge, not wantingeyes
 I only hope that I shall keep in your memory the kind place you havegiven me
 You are almost my friend now, and I know it
 You do not knowthat I love you
K
Beloved: You love me! I know it now, and bless the sun and the moon andthe stars for the dear certainty of it
 And I ask you now, O heart thathas opened to me, have I once been unhappy or impatient while this goodthing has been withheld from me? Indeed my love for you has occupied metoo completely: I have been so glad to find how much there is to learn ina good heart deeply unconscious of its own goodness
 You have employed meas I wish I may be employed all the days of my life: and now my belovedemployer has given me the wages I did not ask
You love me! Is it a question of little or much? Is it not rather anentire new thought of me that has entered your life, as the thought of youentered mine months that seem years ago? It was the seed then, and seemedsmall; but the whole life was there; and it has grown and grown till nowit is I who have become small, and have hardly room in me for the roots:and it seems to have gone so far up over my head that I wonder if thestars know of my happiness
They must know of yours too, then, my Beloved: they are no company for mewithout you
 Oh, to-day, to-day of all days! how in my heart I shall go onkissing it till I die! You love me: that is wonderful! You love me: andalready it is not wonderful in the least! but belongs to Noah and the arkand all the animals saved up for an earth washed clean and dried, and thenew beginnings of time which have ever since been twisting and turningwith us in safe keeping through all the history of the world
"We came over at the Norman conquest," my dear, as people say trailingtheir pedigree: but there was no ancestral pride about us--it was all forthe love of the thing we did it: how clear it seems now! In the hall hangsa portrait in a big wig, but otherwise the image of my father, of a manwho flouted the authority of James II
 merely because he was so like myfather in character that he could do nothing else
 I shall look for younow in the Bayeux tapestries with a prong from your helmet down the middleof your face--of which that line on your forehead is the remainder
 Andyou love me! I wonder what the line has to do with that?By such little things do great things seem to come about: not really
 Iknow it was not because I said just what I did say, and did what I didyesterday, that your heart was bound to come for mine
 But it was thosesmall things that brought you consciousness: and when we parted I knewthat I had all the world at my feet--or all heaven over my head!Ah, at last I may let the spirit of a kiss go to you from me, and not beashamed or think myself forward since I have your love
 All this time youare thinking of me: a certainty lying far outside what I can see
Beloved, if great happiness may be set to any words, it is here! Ifsilence goes better with it,--speak, silence, for me when I end now!Good-night, and think greatly of me! I shall wake early
L
Dearest: Was my heart at all my own,--was it my own to give, till you cameand made me aware of how much it contains? Truly, dear, it containednothing before, since now it contains you and nothing else
 So I have abrand-new heart to give away: and you, you want it and can't see thatthere it is staring you in the face like a rose with all its petals readyto drop
I am quite sure that if I had not met you, I could have loved nobody as Ilove you
 Yet it is very likely that I should have loved--sufficiently, asthe way of the world goes
 It is not a romantic confession, but it is trueto life: I do so genuinely like most of my fellow-creatures, and am nothappy except where shoulders rub socially:--that is to say, have not untilnow been happy, except dependently on the company and smiles of others
Now, Beloved, I have none of your company, and have had but few of yoursmiles (I could count them all); yet I have become more happy filling upmy solitude with the understanding of you which has made me wise, thanall the rest of fate or fortune could make me
 Down comes autumn's sadheart and finds me gay; and the asters, which used to chill me at theirappearing, have come out like crocuses this year because it is thebeginning of a new world
And all the winter will carry more than a suspicion of summer with it,just as the longest days carry round light from northwest to northeast,because so near the horizon, but out of sight, lies their sun
 So you,Beloved, so near to me now at last, though out of sight
M
Beloved: Whether I have sorry or glad things to think about, they areaccompanied and changed by thoughts of you
 You are my diary:--all goes toyou now
 That you love me is the very light by which I see everything
Also I learn so much through having you in my thoughts: I cannot say howit is, for I have no more knowledge of life than I had before:--yet I amwiser, I believe, knowing much more what lives at the root of things andwhat men have meant and felt in all they have done:--because I love you,dearest
 Also I am quicker in my apprehensions, and have more joy and morefear in me than I had before
 And if this seems to be all about myself,it is all about you really, Beloved!Last week one of my dearest old friends, our Rector, died: a character youtoo would have loved
 He was a father to the whole village, rather sternof speech, and no respecter of persons
 Yet he made a very generousallowance for those who did not go through the church door to find theirsalvation
 I often went only because I loved him: and he knew it
I went for that reason alone last Sunday
 The whole village was full ofclosed blinds: and of all things over him Chopin's Funeral March wasplayed!--a thing utterly unchristian in its meaning: wild pagan grief,desolate over lost beauty
 "Balder the beautiful is dead, is dead!" itcried: and I thought of you suddenly; you, who are not Balder at all
Too many thorns have been in your life, but not the mistletoe strokedealt by a blind god ignorantly
 Yet in all great joy there is theBalder element: and I feared lest something might slay it for me, and mylife become a cry like Chopin's march over mown-down unripened grass,and youth slain in its high places
After service a sort of processional instinct drew people up to the house:they waited about till permission was given, and went in to look at theirold man, lying in high state among his books
 I did not go
 Beloved, Ihave never yet seen death: you have, I know
 Do you, I wonder, rememberyour father better than I mine:--or your brother? Are they more livingbecause you saw them once not living? I think death might open our eyes tothose we lived on ill terms with, but not to the familiar and dear
 I donot need you dead, to be certain that your heart has mine for its trueinmate and mine yours
I love you, I love you: so let good-night bring you good-morning!N
At long intervals, dearest, I write to you a secret all about yourself formy eyes to see: because, chiefly because, I have not you to look at
 ThusI bless myself with you
Away over the world west of this and a little bit north is the city ofspires where you are now
 Never having seen it I am the more free topicture it as I like: and to me it is quite full of you:--quite greedilyfull, Beloved, when elsewhere you are so much wanted! I send my thoughtsthere to pick up crumbs for me
It is a strange blend of notions--wisdom and ignorance combined: for_you_ I seem to know perfectly; but of your life nothing at all
 Andyet nobody there knows so much about you as I
 What you _do_ matters somuch less than what you are
 You, who are the clearest heart in all theworld, do what you will, you are so still to me, Beloved
I take a happy armful of thoughts about you into all my dreams: and whenI wake they are there still, and have done nothing but remain true
 Whatbetter can I ask of them?You do love me: you have not changed? Without change I remain yours solong as I live
O
And you, Beloved, what are you thinking of me all this while? Think wellof me, I beg you: I deserve so much, loving you as truly as I do!So often, dearest, I sit thinking my hands into yours again as when wewere saying good-by the last time
 Then it was, under our laughter andlight words, that I saw suddenly how the thing too great to name hadbecome true, that from friends we were changed into lovers
 It seemed themost natural thing to be, and yet was wonderful--for it was I who lovedyou first: a thing I could never be ashamed of, and am now proud toown--for has it not proved me wise? My love for you is the best wisdomthat I have
 Good-night, dearest! Sleep as well as I love you, and nobodyin the world will sleep so soundly
P
A few times in my life, Beloved, I have had the Blue-moon-hunger forsomething which seemed too impossible and good ever to come true: prosaicpeople call it being "in the blues"; I comfort myself with a prettier wordfor it
 To-day, not the Blue-moon itself, but the Man of it came down andate plum-porridge with me! Also, I do believe that it burnt his mouth, andam quite reasonably happy thinking so, since it makes me know that youlove me as much as ever
If I have had doubts, dearest, they have been of myself, lest I might beunworthy of your friendship or love
 Suspicions of you I never had
Who wrote that suspicions among thoughts are like bats among birds, flyingonly by twilight?But even my doubts have been thoughts, Beloved,--sure of you if not alwaysof myself
 And if I have looked for you only with doubtful vision, yet Ihave always seen you in as strong a light as my eyes could bear:--blue-moonlight
 Beloved, is not twilight: and blue-moonlight has been thelight I saw you by: it is you alone who can make sunlight of it
This I read yesterday has lain on my mind since as true and altogetherbeautiful, with the beauty of major, not of minor poetry, though it wasa minor poet who wrote it
 It is of a wood where Apollo has gone inquest of his Beloved, and she is not yet to be found:      "Here each branch    Sway'd with a glitter all its crowded leaves,    And brushed the soft divine hair touching them    In ruffled clusters



      Suddenly the moon    Smoothed herself out of vapor-drift and made    The deep night full of pleasure in the eye    Of her sweet motion
 Not alone she came    Leading the starlight with her like a song:    And not a bud of all that undergrowth    But crisped and tingled out an ardent edge    As the light steeped it: over whose massed leaves    The portals of illimitable sleep    Faded in heaven
"That is love in its moonrise, not its sunrise stage: yet you see
Beloved, how it takes possession of its dark world, quite as fully asthe brighter sunlight could do
 And if I speak of doubts, I mean notwilight and no suspicions: nor by darkness do I mean any unhappiness
My blue-moon has come, leading the starlight with her like a song
 Am Inot happy enough to be patiently yours before you know it? Good thingswhich are to be, before they happen are already true
 Nothing is so trueas you are, except my love for you and yours for me
 Good-night,good-night
Sleep well, Beloved, and wake
Q
Beloved: I heard somebody yesterday speak of you as "charming"; and Ibegan wondering to myself was that the word which could ever have coveredmy thoughts of you? I do not know whether you ever charmed me, except inthe sense of charming which means magic and spell-binding
 _That_ you didfrom the beginning, dearest
 But I think I held you at first in too muchawe to discover charm in you: and at last knew you too much to the depthsto name you by a word so lightly used for the surface of things
 Yet now acharm in you, which is not _all_ you, but just a part of you, comes tolight, when I see you wondering whether you are really loved, or whether,Beloved, I only _like_ you rather well!Well, if you will be so "charming," I am helpless: and can do nothing,nothing, but pray for the blue-moon to rise, and love you a little betterbecause you have some of that divine foolishness which strikes the verywise ones of earth, and makes them kin to weaker mortals who otherwisemight miss their "charm" altogether
Truly, Beloved, if I am happy, it is because I am also your most patientlyloving
R
Beloved: The certainty which I have now that you love me so fills all mythoughts, I cannot understand you being in any doubt on your side
 Whatmust I do that I do not do, to show gladness when we meet and sorrow whenwe have to part? I am sure that I make no pretense or disguise, exceptthat I do not stand and wring my hands before all the world, and cry"Don't go!"--which has sometimes been in my mind, to be kept _not_ said!Indeed, I think so much of you, my dear, that I believe some day, if youdo your part, you will only have to look up from your books to find mestanding
 If you did, would you still be in doubt whether I loved you?Oh, if any apparition of me ever goes to you, all my thoughts will surelylook truthfully out of its eyes; and even you will read what is there atlast!Beloved, I kiss your blind eyes, and love them the better for all theirunreadiness to see that I am already their slave
 Not a day now but Ithink I may see you again: I am in a golden uncertainty from hour to hour
I love you: you love me: a mist of blessing swims over my eyes as I writethe words, till they become one and the same thing: I can no longer dividetheir meaning in my mind
 Amen: there is no need that I should
S
Beloved: I have not written to you for quite a long time: ah, I could not
I have nothing now to say! I think I could very easily die of this greathappiness, so certainly do you love me! Just a breath more of it and Ishould be gone
Good-by, dearest, and good-by, and good-by! If you want letters from menow, you must ask for them! That the earth contains us both, and that welove each other, is about all that I have mind enough to take in
 I do notthink I can love you more than I do: you are no longer my dream but mygreat waking thought
 I am waiting for no blue-moonrise now: my heart hasnot a wish which you do not fulfill
 I owe you my whole life, and for anygood to you must pay it out to the last farthing, and still feel myselfyour debtor
Oh, Beloved, I am most poor and most rich when I think of your love
Good-night; I can never let thought of you go!       *       *       *       *       *Beloved: These are almost all of them, but not quite; a few here and therehave cried to be taken out, saying they were still too shy to be lookedat
 I can't argue with them: they know their own minds best; and you knowmine
See what a dignified historic name I have given this letter-box, orchatterbox, or whatever you like to call it
 But "Resurrection Pie" is_my_ name for it
 Don't eat too much of it, prays your loving
LETTER XXIII
Saving your presence, dearest, I would rather have Prince Otto, a verylovable character for second affections to cling to
 Richard Feverel wouldnever marry again, so I don't ask for him: as for the rest, they are alltoo excellent for me
 They give me the impression of having worncopy-books under their coats, when they were boys, to cheat punishment:and the copy-books got beaten into their systems
You must find me somebody who was a "gallous young hound" in the days ofhis youth--Crossjay, for instance:--there! I have found the very man forme!But really and truly, are you better? It will not hurt your foot to cometo me, since I am not to come to you? How I long to see you again,dearest! it is an age! As a matter of fact, it is a fortnight: but I dreadlest you will find some change in me
 I have kept a real white hair toshow you, I drew it out of my comb the other morning: wound up into a curlit becomes quite visible, and it is ivory-white: you are not to think itflaxen, and take away its one wee sentiment! And I make you an offer:--youshall have it if, honestly, you can find in your own head a white one toexchange
Dearest, I am not _hurt_, nor do I take seriously to heart your mother'spresent coldness
 How much more I could forgive her when I put myself inher place! She may well feel a struggle and some resentment at having togive up in any degree her place with you
 All my selfishness would cometo the front if that were demanded of me
Do not think, because I leave her alone, that I am repaying her coldnessin the same coin
 I know that for the present anything I do must offend
Have I demanded your coming too soon? Then stay away another day--ortwo: every day only piles up the joy it will be to have your arms roundme once more
 I can keep for a little longer: and the gray hair willkeep, and many to-morrows will come bringing good things for us, whenperhaps your mother's "share of the world" will be over
Don't say it, but when you next kiss her, kiss her for me also: I amsorry for all old people: their love of things they are losing is so farmore to be reverenced and made room for than ours of the things whichwill come to us in good time abundantly
To-night I feel selfish at having too much of your love: and not a bitof it can I let go! I hope, Beloved, we shall live to see each other'sgray hairs in earnest: gray hairs that we shall not laugh at, as at thisone I pulled
 How dark your dear eyes will look with a white setting! Myheart's heart, every day you grow larger round me, and I so muchstronger depending upon you!I won't say--come for certain, to-morrow: but come if, and as soon as,you can
 I seem to see a mile further when I am on the lookout for you:and I shall be long-sighted every day until you come
 It is only_doubtful_ hope deferred which maketh the heart sick
 I am as happy asthe day is long waiting for you: but the day _is_ long, dearest, nonethe less when I don't see you
All this space on the page below is love
 I have no time left to put itinto words, or words into it
 You bless my thoughts constantly
--Believeme, never your thoughtless
LETTER XXIV
Dearest: How, when, and where is there any use wrangling as towhich of us loves the other the best ("the better," I believe, would bethe more grammatical phrase in incompetent Queen's English), and why inthat of all things should we pretend to be rivals? For this at leastseems certain to me, that, being created male and female, no two loverssince the world began ever loved each other quite in the _same_ way: itis not in nature for it to be so
 They cannot compare: only to the bestthat is in them they _do_ love each after their kind,--as do we forcertain!Be sure, then, that I am utterly contented with what I get (and you,Beloved, and you?): nay, I wonder forever at the love you have given me:and if I will to lay mine at your feet, and feel yours crowning mylife,--why, so it is, you know; you cannot alter it! And if you insistthat your love is at _my_ feet, I have only to turn Irish and reply thatit is because I am heels over head in love with you:--and, mark you,that is no pretty attitude for a lady that you have driven me into inorder that I may stick to my "crown"!Go to, dearest! There is one thing in which I can beat you, and that isin the bandying of words and all verbal conjurings: take this as thelast proof of it and rest quiet
 I know you love me a great great dealmore than I have wit or power to love you: and that is just the littlereason why your love mounts till, as I tell you, it crowns me (head orheels): while mine, insufficient and groveling, lies at your feet, andwill till they become amputated
 And I can give you, but won't, sixtyother reasons why things are as I say, and are to be left as I say
 Andoh, my world, my world, it is with you I go round sunwards, and you makemy evenings and mornings, and will, till Time shuts his wings over us!And now it is doleful business I have to write to you



I have dropped to sleep over all this writing of things, and my cheek downon the page has made the paper unwilling to take the ink again:--what apretty compliment to me: and, if you prefer it, what an easy way ofwriting to you! I can send you such any day and be as idle as I like
 Andyou will decide about all the above exactly as you and I think best (orshould it be "better" again, being only between us two?)
 When you getthis, blow your beloved self a kiss in the glass for me,--a great bigshattering blow that shall astonish Mercury behind his window-pane
Good-night, my best--or "better," for that is what I most want you to be
LETTER XXV
My Own Beloved: And I never thanked you yesterday for your dear wordsabout the resurrection pie; that comes of quarreling! Well, you must provethem and come quickly that I may see this restoration of health andspirits that you assure me of
 You avoid saying that they sent you tosleep; but I suppose that is what you mean
Fate meant me only to light upon gay things this morning: listen to thisand guess where it comes from:    "When March with variant winds was past,     And April had with her silver showers     Ta'en leif at life with an orient blast;     And lusty May, that mother of flowers,     Had made the birds to begin their hours,     Among the odours ruddy and white,     Whose harmony was the ear's delight:    "In bed at morrow I sleeping lay;     Methought Aurora, with crystal een,     In at the window looked by day,     And gave me her visage pale and green;     And on her hand sang a lark from the splene,     'Awake ye lovers from slumbering!     See how the lusty morrow doth spring!'"Ah, but you are no scholar of the things in your own tongue! That isDunbar, a Scots poet contemporary of Henry VII
, just a little bitaltered by me to make him soundable to your ears
 If I had not had toleave an archaic word here and there, would you ever have guessed he layoutside this century? That shows the permanent element in all goodpoetry, and in all good joy in things also
 In the four centuries sincethat was written we have only succeeded in worsening the meaning ofcertain words, as for instance "spleen," which now means irritation andvexation, but stood then for quite the opposite--what we should call, Isuppose, "a full heart
" It is what I am always saying--a good digestionis the root of nearly all the good living and high thinking we arecapable of: and the spleen was then the root of the happy emotions as itis now of the miserable ones
 Your pre-Reformation lark sang from "afull stomach," and thanked God it had a constitution to carry it offwithout affectation: and your nineteenth century lark applying the samecode of life, his plain-song is mere happy everyday prose, and notpoetry at all as we try to make it out to be
I have no news for you at all of anyone: all inside the house is asimmer of peace and quiet, with blinds drawn down against the heat thewhole day long
 No callers; and as for me, I never call elsewhere
 Thegossips about here eke out a precarious existence by washing eachother's dirty linen in public: and the process never seems to result inany satisfactory cleansing
I avoid saying what news I trust to-morrow's post-bag may contain forme
 Every wish I send you comes "from the spleen," which means I am veryhealthy, and, conditionally, as happy as is good for me
 Pray God blessmy dear Share of the world, and make him get well for his own and mysake! Amen
This catches the noon post, an event which always shows I am jubilant,with a lot of the opposite to a "little death" feeling running over mynerves
 I feel the grass growing _under_ me: the reverse of poor Keats'complaint
 Good-by, Beloved, till I find my way into the provender ofto-morrow's post-bag
LETTER XXVI

 Roberts is carrying orders into town, and will bringyou this with a touch of the hat and an amused grin under it
 I saw youright on the top Sallis Hill: this is to wager that my eyes have told mecorrectly
 Look out for me from far away, I am at my corner window: waveto me! Dearest, this is to kiss you before I can
LETTER XXVII
Dearest: I have made a bad beginning of the week: I wonder how it willend? it all comes of my not seeing enough of you
 Time hangs heavy on myhands, and the Devil finds me the mischief!I prevailed upon myself to go on Sunday and listen to our new latelyappointed vicar: for I thought it not fair to condemn him on the strengthof Mrs
 P----'s terrible reporting powers and her sensuous worship of hisfull-blown flowers of speech--"pulpit-pot-plants" is what I call them
It was not worse and not otherwise than I had expected
 I find there areonly two kinds of clerics as generally necessary to salvation in a countryparish--one leads his parishioners to the altar and the other to thepulpit: and the latter is vastly the more popular among the articulate andgad-about members of his flock
 This one sways himself over the edge ofhis frame, making signals of distress in all directions, and with that andhis windy flights of oratory suggests twenty minutes in a balloon-car,till he comes down to earth at the finish with the Doxology for aparachute
 His shepherd's crook is one long note of interrogation, withwhich he tries to hook down the heavens to the understanding of hishearers, and his hearers up to an understanding of himself

 Your Protestant ignores Lent as a Popishdevice, a fond thing vainly invented: but spreads it instead overfifty-two days in the year
 Why, I want to know, cannot I change thesubject?Sunday we get no post (and no collection except in church) unless we senddown to the town for it, so Monday is all the more welcome: but this Ihave been up and writing before it arrives--therefore the "snaps

 But in the afternoon that same Mrs

 And my love to yourmother, please, if she will have it
 It is only through her that I getyou

LETTER XXVIII
Dearest: Here comes a letter to you from me flying in the oppositedirection
 I won't say I am not wishing to go; but oh, to be a bird in twoplaces at once! Give this letter, then, a special nesting-place, because Iam so much on the wing elsewhere
I shut my eyes most of the time through France, and opened them on asoup-tureen full of coffee which presented itself at the frontier: andthen realized that only a little way ahead lay Berne, with baths, buns,bears, breakfast, and other nice things beginning with B, waiting to makeus clean, comfortable, contented, and other nice things beginning with C
Through France I loved you sleepy fashion, with many dreams in between notall about you
 But now I am breathing thoughts of you out of a newatmosphere--a great gulp of you, all clean-living and high-thinkingbetween these Alpine royal highnesses with snow-white crowns to theirheads: and no time for a word more about anything except you: you, anddouble-you,--and treble-you if the alphabet only had grace to contain sobeautiful a symbol! Good-by: we meet next, perhaps, out of Lucerne: ifnot,--Italy
What a lot I have to go through before we meet again visibly! You willfind me world-worn, my Beloved! Write often
LETTER XXIX
Beloved: You know of the method for making a cat settle down ina strange place by buttering her all over: the theory being that by thetime she has polished off the butter she feels herself at home? Mymorning's work has been the buttering of the Mother-Aunt with suchthings as will Lucerne her the most
 When her instincts are appeased Iam the more free to indulge my own
So after breakfast we went round the cloisters, very thick set withtablets and family vaults, and crowded graves inclosed
 It proved quite"the best butter
" To me the penance turned out interesting after aperiod of natural repulsion
 A most unpleasant addition to sepulchralsentiment is here the fashion: photographs of the departed set into thestone
 You see an elegant and genteel marble cross: there on thepedestal above the name is the photo:--a smug man with bourgeoiswhiskers,--a militiaman with waxed mustaches well turned up,--a womanwell attired and conscious of it: you cannot think how indecent lookedthe pretension of such types to the dignity of death and immortality
But just one or two faces stood the test, and were justified: a youngman oppressed with the burden of youth; a sweet, toothless grandmotherin a bonnet, wearing old age like a flower; a woman not beautiful butfor her neck which carried indignation; her face had a thwarted look
"Dead and rotten" one did not say of these in disgust and involuntarilyas one did of the others
 And yet I don't suppose the eye picks out thefaces that kindled most kindness round them when living, or that one cansee well at all where one sees without sympathy
 I think theMother-Aunt's face would not look dear to most people as it does tome,--yet my sight of her is the truer: only I would not put it up on atombstone in order that it might look nothing to those that pass by
I wrote this much, and then, leaving the M
-A
 to glory in herinnumerable correspondence, Arthur and I went off to the lake, where wehave been for about seven hours
 On it, I found it become infinitelymore beautiful, for everything was mystified by a lovely bloomy haze,out of which the white peaks floated like dreams: and the mountainschange and change, and seem not all the same as going when returning
Don't ask me to write landscape to you: one breathes it in, and it isthere ever after, but remains unset to words
The T----s whittle themselves out of our company just to the rightamount: come back at the right time (which is more than Arthur and I arelikely to do when our legs get on the spin), and are duly welcome with adiversity of doings to talk about
 Their tastes are more the M

Arthur growls and threatens he means to be left behind for a week: andit suits the funny little jealousy of the M

 well enough to see usparted for a time, quite apart from the fact that I shall then be moredependent on her company
 She will then glory in overworkingherself,--say it is me; and I shall feel a fiend
 No letter at all,dearest, this; merely talky-talky
--Yours without words
LETTER XXX
Dearest: I cannot say I have seen Pisa, for the majority hadtheir way, and we simply skipped into it, got ourselves bumped down atthe Duomo and Campo Santo for two hours, fell exhausted to bed, andskipped out again by the first train next morning
 Over the walls of theCampo Santo are some divine crumbs of Benozzo Gozzoli (don't expect meever to spell the names of dead painters correctly: it is a politenessone owes to the living, but the famous dead are exalted by being speltphonetically as the heart dictates, and become all the better companyfor that greatest of unspelled and spread-about names--Shakspere,Shakspeare, Shakespeare--his mark, not himself)
 Such a long parenthesisrequires stepping-stones to carry you over it: "crumbs" was the last(wasn't a whole loaf of bread a stepping-stone in one of Andersen'sfairy-tales?): but, indeed, I hadn't time to digest them properly
 Letme come back to them before I die, and bury me in that inclosure if youlove me as much then as I think you do now
The Baptistry has a roof of echoes that is wonderful,--a mirror of soundhung over the head of an official who opens his mouth for centimes todrop there
 You sing notes up into it (or rather you don't, for that ishis perquisite), and they fly circling, and flock, and become a singlechord stretching two octaves: till you feel that you are living insidewhat in the days of our youth would have been called "the sound of agrand Amen
"The cathedral has fine points, or more than points--aspects: but theItalian version of Gothic, with its bands of flat marbles instead ofmoldings, was a shock to me at first
 I only begin to understand it nowthat I have seen the outside of the Duomo at Florence
 Curiously enough,it doesn't strike me as in the least Christian, only civic and splendid,reminding me of what Ruskin says about church architecture being reallya dependant on the feudal or domestic
 The Strozzi Palace is a beautifulpiece of street-architecture; its effect is of an iron hand which givesyou a buffet in the face when you look up and wonder--how shall I climbin? I will tell you more about insides when I write next
I fear my last letter to you from Lucerne may either have strayed, or noteven have begun straying: for in the hurry of coming away I left it,addressed, I _think_, but unstamped; and I am not sure that thatparticular hotel will be Christian enough to spare the postage out of thebill, which had a galaxy of small extras running into centimes, andsuggesting a red-tape rectitude that would not show blindtwenty-five-centime gratitude to the backs of departed guests
 So bepatient and forgiving if I seem to have written little
 I found two ofyours waiting for me, and cannot choose between them which I find mostdear
 I will say, for a fancy, the shorter, that you may ever beencouraged to write your shortest rather than none at all
 One word fromyou gives me almost as much pleasure as twenty, for it contains all yoursincerity and truth; and what more do I want? Yon bless me quite
 How manyperfectly happy days I owe to you, and seldom dare dream that I have madeany beginning of a return! If I could take one unhappy day out of yourlife, dearest, the secret would be mine, and no such thing should be leftin it
 Be happy, beloved! oh, happy, happy,--with me for a partialreason--that is what I wish!LETTER XXXI
Dearest: The Italian paper-money paralyzes my brain: I cannotcalculate in it; and were I left to myself an unscrupulous shopman couldempty me of pounds without my becoming conscious of it till I beheldvacuum
 But the T----s have been wonderful caretakers to me: andto-morrow Arthur rejoins us, so that I shall be able to resume my fullactivities under his safe-conduct
The ways of the Italian cabbies and porters fill me with terror for thetime when I may have to fall alive and unassisted into their hands: theyhave neither conscience nor gratitude, and regard thievish demands whensatisfied merely as stepping-stones to higher things
Many of the outsides of Florence I seemed to know by heart--the PalazzoVecchio for instance
 But close by it Cellini's two statues, the Judithand the Perseus, brought my heart up to my mouth unexpectedly
 ThePerseus is so out of proportion as to be ludicrous from one point ofview: but another is magnificent enough to make me forgive the scamp hisautobiography from now to the day of judgment (when we shall all beginforgiving each other in great haste, I suppose, for fear of the deviltaking the hindmost!), and I registered a vow on the spot to thateffect:--so no more of him here, henceforth, but good!There is not so much color about as I had expected: and austerity ratherthan richness is the note of most of the exteriors
I have not been allowed into the Uffizi yet, so to-day consoled myselfwith the Pitti
 Titian's "Duke of Norfolk" is there, and I loved him,seeing a certain likeness there to somebody whom I--like
 A photo of himwill be coming to you
 Also there is a very fine Lely-Vandyck of CharlesI
 and Henrietta Maria, a quite moral painting, making a triumphantassertion of that martyr's bad character
 I imagine he got into heaventhrough having his head cut off and cast from him: otherwise all of himwould have perished along with his mouth
Somewhere too high up was hanging a ravishing Botticelli--a Madonna andChild bending over like a wind-blown tree to be kissed by St
 John:--acomposition that takes you up in its arms and rocks you as you look atit
 Andrea del Sarto is to me only a big mediocrity: there is nothinghere to touch his chortling child-Christ in our National Gallery
At Pisa I slept in a mosquito-net, and felt like a bride at the altarunder a tulle veil which was too large for her
 Here, for lack of thatluxury, being assured that there were no mosquitoes to be had, I havebeen sadly ravaged
 The creatures pick out all foreigners, I think, andonly when they have exhausted the supply do they pass on to the natives
Mrs
 T---- left one foot unveiled when in Pisa, and only this morningdid the irritation in the part bitten begin to come out
I can now ask for a bath in Italian, and order the necessary things formyself in the hotel: also say "come in" and "thank you
" But just thefew days of that very German _table d'hôte_ at Lucerne, where I talkedgladly to polish myself up, have given my tongue a hybrid way of talkingwithout thinking: and I say "_ja, ja_," and "_nein_," and "_der, die,das_," as often as not before such Italian nouns as I have yet captured
To fall upon a chambermaid who knows French is like coming upon mynative tongue suddenly
Give me good news of your foot and all that is above it: I am so doubtfulof its being really strong yet; and its willing spirits will overcome itsome day and do it an injury, and hurt my feelings dreadfully at the sametime
Walk only on one leg whenever you think of me! I tell you truly I amwonderfully little lonely: and yet my thoughts are constantly away withyou, wishing, wishing,--what no word on paper can ever carry to you
 Itshall be at our next meeting!--All yours
LETTER XXXII
My Dearest: Florence is still eating up all my time and energies: Ipromised you there should be austerity and self-denial in the matter ofletter-writing: and I know you are unselfish enough to expect even lessthan I send you
Girls in the street address compliments to Arthur's complexion:--"beautiful brown boy" they call him: and he simmers over with vanity, andwishes he could show them his boating arms, brown up to the shoulder, aswell
 Have you noticed that combination in some of the dearest specimensof young English manhood,--great physical vanity and great mental modesty?and each as transparently sincere as the other
The Bargello is an ideal museum for the storage of the best things out ofthe Middle Ages
 It opens out of splendid courtyards and staircases, andranges through rooms which have quite a feudal gloom about them; most ofthese are hung with bad late tapestries (too late at least for my taste),so that the gloom is welcome and charming, making even "Gobelins" quitebearable
 I find quite a new man here to admire--Pollaiolo, both painterand sculptor, one of the school of "passionate anatomists," as I callthem, about the time of Botticelli, I fancy
 He has one bust of a youngFlorentine which equals Verocchio on the same ground, and charms me evenmore
 Some of his subjects are done twice over, in paint and bronze: buthe is more really a sculptor, I think, and merely paints his piece into apicture from its best point of view
Verocchio's idea of David is charming: he is a saucy fellow who has gonein for it for the fun of the thing--knew he could bring down a hawk withhis catapult, and therefore why not a Goliath also? If he failed, heneed but cut and run, and everybody would laugh and call him plucky fordoing even that much
 So he does it, brings down his big game by goodluck, and stands posing with a sort of irresistible stateliness to suitthe result
 He has a laugh something like "little Dick's," only morefull of bubbles, and is saying to himself, "What a hero they all thinkme!" He is the merriest of sly-dog hypocrites, and has thin, wiry armsand a craney neck
 He is a bit like Tom Sawyer in character, more ornateand dramatic than Huckleberry Finn, but quite as much a liar, given agood cause
Another thing that has seized me, more for its idea than actual carryingout, is an unnamed terra-cotta Madonna and Child
 He is crushing himselfup against her neck, open-mouthed and terrified, and she spreading longfingers all over his head and face
 My notion of it is that it is theGodhead taking his first look at life from the human point of view; andhe realizes himself "caught in his own trap," discovering it to be everso much worse than it had seemed from an outside view
 It is a finemodern _zeit-geist_ piece of declamation to come out of the ratherover-sweet della Robbia period of art
There seems to have been a rage at one period for commissioning statuesof David: so Donatello and others just turned to and did what they likedmost in the way of budding youth, stuck a Goliath's head at its feet,and called it "David
" Verocchio is the exception
We are going to get outside Florence for a week or ten days; it is toohot to be borne at night after a day of tiring activity
 So we go to theD----s' villa, which they offered us in their absence; it lies aboutfour miles out, and is on much higher ground: address only your veryimmediately next letter there, or it may miss me
There are hills out there with vineyards among them which draw me intowishing to be away from towns altogether
 Much as I love what is to befound in this one, I think Heaven meant me to be "truly rural"; whichall falls in, dearest, with what _I_ mean to be! Beloved, how little Isometimes can say to you! Sometimes my heart can put only silence intothe end of a letter; and with that I let this one go
--Yours, and solovingly
LETTER XXXIII
Beloved: I had your last letter on Friday: all your letters have come intheir right numbers
 I have lost count of mine; but I think seven and twopostcards is the total, which is the same as the numbers of clean andunclean beasts proportionately represented in the ark
Up here we are out of the deadliness of the heat, and are thankful for it
Vineyards and olives brush the eyes between the hard, upright bars of thecypresses: and Florence below is like a hot bath which we dip into andcome out again
 At the Riccardi chapel I found Benozzo Gozzoli, not incrumbs, but perfectly preserved: a procession of early Florentine youths,turning into angels when they get to the bay of the window where the altaronce stood
 The more I see of them, the greater these early men seem tome: I shall be afraid to go to Venice soon; Titian will only half satisfyme, and Tintoretto, I know, will be actively annoying: I shall stay in mygondola, as your American lady did on her donkey after riding twentymiles to visit the ruins, of--Carnac, was it not? It is well to have thecourage of one's likings and dislikings, that is the only true culture(the state obtained by use of a "coulter" or cutter)--I cut many thingsseverely which, no doubt, are good for other people
Botticelli I was shy of, because of the craze about him among people whoknow nothing: he is far more wonderful than I had hoped, both at theUffizi and the Academia: but he is quite pagan
 I don't know why I say"but"; he is quite typical of the world's art-training: Christianity mayget hold of the names and dictate the subjects, but the artist-breedcarries a fairly level head through it all, and, like Pater's Mona Lisa,draws Christianity and Paganism into one: at least, wherever it reachesperfect expression it has done so
 Some of the distinctly primitives aredifferent; their works inclose a charm which is not artistic
 FraAngelico, after being a great disappointment to me in some of his largeset pictures in the Academia and elsewhere, shows himself lovely in fresco(though I think the "crumb" element helps him)
 His great Crucifixion isbig altogether, and has so permanent a force in its aloofness from meredrama and mere life
 In San Marco, the cells of the monks are quitecharming, a row of little square bandboxes under a broad rafteredcorridor, and in every cell is a beautiful little fresco for the monks tolive up to
 But they no longer live there now: all that part of San Marcohas become a peep-show
I liked being in Savonarola's room, and was more susceptible to theremains of his presence than I have been to Michel Angelo or anyoneelse's
 Michel Angelo I feel most when he has left a thing unfinished;then one can put one's finger into the print of the chisel, and believeanything of the beauty that might have come out of the great stonechrysalis lying cased and rough, waiting to be raised up to life
Yesterday Arthur and I walked from here to Fiesole, which we hadneglected while in Florence--six miles going, and more like twelvecoming back, all because of Arthur's absurd cross-country instinct,which, after hours of river-bends, bare mountain tracks, and totteringprecipices, brought us out again half a mile nearer Florence than whenwe started
At Fiesole is the only church about here whose interior architecture Ihave greatly admired, austere but at the same time gracious--like aMadonna of the best period of painting
 We also went to look at theRoman baths and theater: the theater is charming enough, because it isstill there: but for the baths--oblongs of stone don't interest me justbecause they are old
 All stone is old: and these didn't even hold waterto give one the real look of the thing
 Too tired, and even more toolazy, to write other things, except love, most dear Beloved
LETTER XXXIV
Dearest: We were to have gone down with the rest into Florenceyesterday: but soft miles of Italy gleamed too invitingly away on ourright, and I saw Arthur's eyes hungry with the same far-away wish
 So Isaid "Prato," and he ran up to the fattore's and secured a wondrousshandry-dan with just space enough between its horns to toss the two ofus in the direction where we would go
 Its gaunt framework was paintedof a bright red, and our feet had only netting to rest on: soconstructed, the creature was most vital and light of limb, taking everyrut on the road with flea-like agility
 Oh, but it was worth it!We had a drive of fourteen miles through hills and villages, andcastellated villas with gardens shut in by formidably high walls--always,a charm: a garden should always have something of the jealous seclusion ofa harem
 I am getting Italian landscape into my system, and enjoy it moreand more
Prato is a little cathedral town, very like the narrow and tumble-downparts of Florence, only more so
 The streets were a seething caldron ofcattle-market when we entered, which made us feel like a tea-cup in abull-ring (or is it thunderstorm?) as we drove through needle's-eye waysbristling with agitated horns
The cathedral is little and good: damaged, of course, wherever the lastthree centuries have laid hands on it
 At the corner of the west frontis an out-door pulpit beautifully put on with a mushroom hood over itshead
 The main lines of the interior are finely severe, either quiteround or quite flat, and proportions good always
 An upholstered priestcoming out to say mass is generally a sickening sight, so wicked andugly in look and costume
 The best-behaved people are the low-downbeggars, who are most decoratively devotional
We tried to model our exit on a brigand-beggar who came in to askpermission to murder one of his enemies
 He got his request granted atone of the side-altars (some strictly local Madonna, I imagine), and hisgratitude as he departed was quite touching
 Having studiously copiedhis exit, we want to know whom we shall murder to pay ourselves for ourtrouble
It amuses me to have my share of driving over these free and easy andvery narrow highroads
 But A
 has to do the collision-shouting and thecries of "Via!"--the horse only smiles when he hears me do it
Also did I tell you that on Saturday we two walked from here over toFiesole--six miles there, and ten back: for why?--because we chose to gowhat Arthur calls "a bee-line across country," having thought we hadsighted a route from the top of Fiesole
 But in the valley we lost it,and after breaking our necks over precipices and our hearts downcul-de-sacs that led nowhere, and losing all the ways that were pointedout to us, for lack of a knowledge of the language, we came out againinto view of Florence about half a mile nearer than when we started andproportionately far away from home
 When he had got me thoroughlyfoot-sore, Arthur remarked complacently, "The right way to see a countryis to lose yourself in it!" I didn't feel the truth of it then: butapplied to other things I perceive its wisdom
 Dear heart, where I havelost myself, what in all the world do I know so well as you?    Your most lost and loving
LETTER XXXV
Beloved: Rain swooped down on us from on high during the night, and thecountry is cut into islands: the river from a rocky wriggling stream hasrisen into a tawny, opaque torrent that roars with a voice a mile long andis become quite unfordable
 The little mill-stream just below has brokenits banks and poured itself away over the lower vineyards into the river;a lot of the vines look sadly upset, generally unhinged and unstrung, yetI am told the damage is really small
 I hope so, for I enjoyed a reallash-out of weather, after the changelessness of the long heat
I have been down in Florence beginning to make my farewells to the manythings I have seen too little of
 We start away for Venice about the endof the week
 At the Uffizi I seem to have found out all my futurefavorites the first day, and very little new has come to me; but most ofthem go on growing
 The Raphael lady is quite wonderful; I think she wasin love with him, and her soul went into the painting though he himselfdid not care for her; and she looks at you and says, "See a miracle: hewas able to paint this, and never knew that I loved him!" It iswonderful that; but I suppose it can be done,--a soul pass into a workand haunt it without its creator knowing anything about how it camethere
 Always when I come across anything like that which has somethinginner and rather mysterious, I tremble and want to get back to you
 Youare the touchstone by which I must test everything that is a little newand unfamiliar
From now onwards, dearest, you must expect only cards for a time: it isnot settled yet whether we stop at Padua on our way in or our way out
 Iam clamoring for Verona also; but that will be off our route, so Arthurand I may go there alone for a couple of greedy days, which I fear willonly leave me dissatisfied and wishing I had had patience to depend oncoming again--perhaps with you!Uncle N
 has written of your numerous visits to him, and I understand youhave been very good in his direction
 He does not speak of loneliness; andwith Anna and her brood next week or now, he will be as happy as histemperament allows him to be when he has nothing to worry over
I am proud to say I have gone brown without freckles
 And are you reallyas cheerful as you write yourself to be? Dearest and best, when is yourholiday to begin; and is it to be with me? Does anywhere on earth holdthat happiness for us both in the near future? I kiss you well, Beloved
LETTER XXXVI
Dearest: Venice is round me as I write! Well, I will not waste my Baedekerknowledge on you,--you too can get a copy; and it is not the panoramicview of things you will be wanting from me: it is my own particular VeniceI am to find out and send you
 So first of all from the heart of it I sendyou mine: when I have kissed you I will go on
 My eyes have been seeing somuch that is new, I shall want a fresh vocabulary for it all
 But mainly Iwant to say, let us be here again together quickly, before we lose anymore of our youth or our two-handed hold on life
 I get short of breaththinking of it!So let it be here, Beloved, that some of our soon-to-be happiness opensand shuts its eyes: for truly Venice is a sleepy place
 I am wanting,and taking, nine hours' sleep after all I do!Outside coming over the flats from Padua, she looked something like amanufacturing town at its ablutions,--a smoky chimney well to the fore:but get near to her and you find her standing on turquoise, her feet setabout with jaspers, and with one of her eyes she ravishes you: and allher campanile are like the "thin flames" of "souls mounting up to God
"That is from without: within she becomes too sensuous and civic in hersplendor to let me think much of souls
 "Rest and be indolent" is themotto for the life she teaches
 The architecture is the song of thelotos-eater built into stone--were I in a more florid mood I would havesaid "swan-song," for the whole stands finished with nothing more to beadded: it has sung itself out: and if there is a moral to it all, nodoubt it is in Ruskin, and I don't wont to read it just now
What I want is you close at hand looking up at all this beauty, andsmiling when I smile, which is your way, as if you had no opinions ofyour own about anything in which you are not a professor
 So you willwrite and agree that I am to have the pleasure of this return to lookforward to? If I know that, I shall be so much more reconciled to allthe joy of the things I am seeing now for the first time: and shall seeso much better the second, Beloved, when your eyes are here helping me
Here is love, dearest! help yourself to just as much as you wish for;though all that I send is good for you! No letter from you sinceFlorence, but I am neither sad nor anxious: only all the more yourloving
LETTER XXXVII
Beloved: The weather is as gray as England to-day, and much rainier
 Tofeel it on my cheeks and be back north with that and warmer things, Iwould go out in it in the face of protests, and had to go alone--notArthur even being in the mood just then for a patriotic quest of theuncomfortable
 I had myself oared into the lagoons across a racing currentand a driving head-wind which made my gondolier bend like a distressedpoplar over his oar; patience on a monument smiling at backsheesh--"allcomes to him who knows
"Of course, for comfort and pleasure, and everything but economy, we havepicked up a gondolier to pet: we making much of him, and he much out ofus
 He takes Arthur to a place where he can bathe--to use his ownexpression--"cleanly," that is to say, unconventionally; and thisappropriately enough is on the borders of a land called "the Garden ofEden" (being named so after its owners)
 He--"Charon," I call him--islarge and of ruddy countenance, and talks English in blinkers--that isto say, gondola English--out of which he could not find words to summonme a cab even if it were not opposed to his interests
 Still there areno cabs to be called in Venice, and he is teaching us that the shortestway is always by water
 If Arthur is not punctually in his gondola by 7A
M
, I hear a call for the "Signore Inglese" go up to his window; andit is hungry Charon waiting to ferry him
Yesterday your friend Mr
 C---- called and took me over to Murano in abeautiful pair-oared boat that simply flew
 There I saw a wonderful apsefilled with mosaic of dull gold, wherein is set a blue-black figure ofthe Madonna, ten heads high and ten centuries old, which almost made mebecome a Mariolatrist on the spot
 She stands leaning up the bend withtwo pale hands lifted in ghostly blessing
 Underfoot the floor is allmosaic, mountainous with age and earthquakes; the architecture classicin the grip of Byzantine Christianity, which is like the spirit of Godmoving on the face of the waters, or Ezekiel prophesying to the drybones
The Colleoni is quite as much more beautiful in fact and seen full-sizeas I had hoped from all smaller reproductions
 A fine equestrian figurealways strikes one as enthroned, and not merely riding; if I can't getthat, I consider a centaur the nobler creature with its human body setdown into the socket of the brute, and all fire--a candle burning atboth ends: which, in a way, is what the centaur means, I imagine?Bellini goes on being wonderful, and for me beats Raphael's BlenheimMadonna period on its own ground
 I hear now that the Raphael lady Iraved over in Florence is no Raphael at all,--which accounts for itbeing so beautiful and interesting--to _me_, I hasten to add
 Raphael'sstudied calmness, his soul of "invisible soap and imperceptible water,"may charm some; me it only chills or leaves unmoved
Is this more about art than you care to hear? I have nothing to sayabout myself, except that I am as happy as a cut-in-half thing can be
Is it any use sending kind messages to your mother? If so, my heart isfull of them
 Bless you, dearest, and good-night
LETTER XXXVIII
Dearest: St
 Mark's inside is entirely different from anything I hadimagined
 I had expected a grove of pillars instead of these wonderfulbreadths of wall; and the marble overlay I had not understood at all tillI saw it
 My admiration mounts every time I enter: it has a differentgloom from any I have ever been in, more joyous and satisfying, not in theleast moody as our own Gothic seems sometimes to be; and saints instead ofdevils look at you solemn-eyed from every corner of shade
A heavy rain turns the Piazza into a lake: this morning Arthur had tocarry me across
 Other foolish Englishwomen were shocked at such means,and paddled their own leaky canoes, or stood on the brink and lookedmiserable
 The effect of rain-pool reflections on the inside of St
Mark's is noticeable, causing it to bloom unexpectedly into freshsubtleties and glories
 The gold takes so sympathetically to any leasttint of color that is in the air, and counts up the altar candles evenunto its furthest recesses and cupolas
I think before I leave Venice I shall find about ten Tintorettos which Ireally like
 Best of all is that Bacchus and Ariadne in the Ducal Palace,of which you gave me the engraving
 His "Marriage of St
 Catherine," whichis there also, has all Veronese's charm of color and what I call his"breeding"; and in the ceiling of the Council Chamber is one splendidfigure of a sea-youth striding a dolphin
Last evening we climbed the San Giorgio campanile for a sunset view ofVenice; it is a much better point of view than the St
 Mark's one, andwe were lucky in our sunset
 Venice again looked like a beautifiedfactory town, blue and blue with smoke and evening mists
 Down below inthe church I met a delightful Capuchin priest who could talk French, anda poor, very young lay-brother who had the holy custody of the eyesheavily upon his conscience when I spoke to him
 I was so sorry for him!The Mother-Aunt is ill in bed; but as she is at the present momentreceiving three visitors, you will understand about how ill
 The factis, she is worn to death with sight-seeing
 I can't stop her; while sheis on her legs it is her duty, and she will
 The consequence is I getrushed through things I want to let soak into me, and have to go again
My only way of getting her to rest has been by deserting her; and then Icome back and receive reproaches with a meek countenance
Mr
 C---- has been good to us and cordial, and brings his gondola oftento our service
 A gondola and pair has quite a different motion from aone-oared gondola; it is like riding a seahorse instead of a sea-camel--almost exciting, only it is so soft in its prancings
He took A
 and myself into the procession which welcomed the crowned headslast Wednesday; the hurly-burly of it was splendid
 We tore down the GrandCanal from end to end, almost cheek by jowl with the royalties; the M
-A
was quite jubilant when she heard we had had such "good places
" Hundredsof gondolas swarmed round; many of them in the old Carpaccio rig-outs,very gorgeous though a little tawdry when taken out of the canvas
 Hut therush and the collisions, and the sound of many waters walloping under thebellies of the gondolas, and the blows of fighting oars--regularunderwater wrestling matches--made it as vivid and amusing as a prolongedOxford and Cambridge boat-race in fancy costume
 Our gondoliers streamedwith the exertion, and looked like men fighting a real battle, and yetenjoyed it thoroughly
 Violent altercations with police-boats don't rufflethem at all; at one moment it looks daggers drawn; at the next it isshrugs and smiles
 Often, from not knowing enough of Italian and Italianways, I get hot all over when an ordinary discussion is going on, thinkingthat blows are about to be exchanged
 The Mother-Aunt had hung a wonderfulsatin skirt out of window for decoration; and when she leaned over it in abodice of the same color, it looked as if she were sitting with her legsout as well! I suppose it was this peculiar effect that, when the King andQueen came by earlier in the morning, won for her a special bow and smile
I must hurry or I shall miss the post that I wish to catch
 There seemslittle chance now of my getting you in Venice; but elsewhere perhaps youwill drop to me out of the clouds
    Your own and most loving
LETTER XXXIX
My Own, Own Beloved: Say that my being away does not seem too long? I havenot had a letter yet, and that makes me somehow not anxious butcompunctious; only writing to you of all I do helps to keep me in goodconscience
 Not the other foot gone to the mender's, I hope, with the sameobstructive accompaniments as went to the setting-up again of the last? IfI don't hear soon, you will have me dancing on wires, which cost as muchby the word as a gondola by the hour
Yesterday we went to see Carpaccio at his best in San Giorgio diSchiavone: two are St
 George pictures, three St
 Jeromes, and two of someother saint unknown to me
 The St
 Jerome series is really a homily on thelove and pathos of animals
 First is St
 Jerome in his study with a sortof unclipped white poodle in the pictorial place of honor, all alone on afloor beautifully swept and garnished, looking up wistfully to his masterbusy at writing (a Benjy saying, "Come and take me for a walk, there's agood saint!")
 Scattered among the adornments of the room are smallbronzes of horses and, I think, birds
 So, of course, these being histastes, when St
 Jerome goes into the wilderness, a lion takes to him, andaccompanies him when he pays a call on the monks in a neighboringmonastery
 Thereupon, holy men of little faith, the entire fraternity taketo their heels and rush upstairs, the hindermost clinging to the skirts ofthe formermost to be hauled the quicker out of harm's way
 And all thewhile the lion stands incorrectly offering the left paw, and Jerome withshrugs tries to explain that even the best butter wouldn't melt in hisdear lion's mouth
 After that comes the tragedy
 St
 Jerome lies dying inexcessive odor of sanctity, and all the monks crowd round him with prayersand viaticums, and the ordinary stuffy pieties of a "happy death," whileJerome wonders feebly what it is he misses in all this to-do for which hecares so little
 And there, elbowed far out into the cold, the lion liesand lifts his poor head and howls because he knows his master is beingtaken from him
 Quite near to him, fastened to a tree, a queer,nondescript, crocodile-shaped dog runs out the length of its tether tocomfort the disconsolate beast: but _la bête humaine_ has got thewhip-hand of the situation
 In another picture is a parrot that has justmimicked a dog, or called "Carlo!" and then laughed: the dog turns hishead away with a sleek, sheepish, shy look, exactly as a sensitive dogdoes when you make fun of him
These are, perhaps, mere undercurrents of pictures which are quiteglorious in color and design, but they help me to love Carpaccio todistraction; and when the others lose me, they hunt through all theCarpaccios in Venice till they find me!Love me a little more if possible while I am so long absent from you! WhatI do and what I think go so much together now, that you will take what Iwrite as the most of me that it is possible to cram in, coming back to youto share everything
Under such an Italian sky as to-day how I would like to see your face!Here, dearest, among these palaces you would be in your peerage, for Ithink you have some southern blood in you
Curious that, with all my fairness, somebody said to me to-day, "But youare not quite English, are you?" And I swore by the nine gods of myancestry that I was nothing else
 But the look is in us: my father had aforeign air, but made up for it by so violent a patriotism that Uncle N
used to call him "John Bull let loose
"My love to England
 Is it showing much autumn yet? My eyes long for greenfields again
 Since I have been in Italy I had not seen one until theother day from the top of St
 Giorgio Maggiore, where one lies in hidingunder the monastery walls
All that I see now quickens me to fresh thoughts of you
 Yet do not expectme to come back wiser: my last effort at wisdom was to fall in love withyou, and there I stopped for good and all
 There I am still, everythingincluded: what do you want more? My letter and my heart both threaten tobe over-weight, so no more of them this time
 Most dearly do I love you
LETTER XL
Beloved: If two days slip by, I don't know where I am when I come towrite; things get so crowded in such a short space of time
 Where I leftoff I know not: I will begin where I am most awake--your letter which Ihave just received
That is well, dearest, that is well indeed: a truce till February! Andsince the struggle then must needs be a sharp one--with only one end, aswe know,--do not vex her now by any overt signs of preparation as if youassumed already that her final arguments were to be as so much chaffbefore the wind
 You do not tell me _what_ she argues, and I do not ask
She does not say I shall not love you enough!To answer businesslike to your questions first: with your forgiveness westay here till the 25th, and get back to England with the last of themonth
 Does that seem a very cruel, far-off date? Others have the wish tostay even longer, and it would be no fairness to hurry them beyond acertain degree of reasonableness with my particular reason forimpatience, seeing, moreover, that in your love I have every help forremaining patient
 It is too much to hope, I suppose, that the "truce"sets you free now, and that you could meet us here after all, and prolongour stay indefinitely? I know one besides myself who would be glad, andwould welcome an outside excuse dearly
For, oh, the funniness of near and dear things! Arthur's heart is laidup with a small love affair, and it is the comicalest of internalmaladies
 He is screwing up courage to tell me all about it, and I writein haste before my mouth is sealed by his confidences
 I fancy I knowthe party, an energetic little mortal whom we met at Lucerne, whereArthur lingered while we came on to Florence
 She talked vaguely ofbeing in Venice some time this autumn; and the vagueness continues
Arthur, in consequence, roams round disconsolately with no interest butin hotel books
 And for fear lest we should gird up his loins and draghim away with us out of Paradisal possibilities, he is forever praisingVenice as a resting-place, and saying he wants to be nowhere else
 Thebathing just keeps him alive; but when put to it to explain what charmshim since pictures do not, and architecture only slightly, he says inexemplary brotherly fashion that he likes to see me completing myeducation and enthusiasms,--and does not realize with how foreign anair that explanation sits upon his shoulders
I saw to-day a remnant of your patron saint, and for your saketransferred a kiss to it, Italian fashion, with my thumb and the sign ofthe cross
 I hope it will do you good
 Also, I have been up among thegalleries of St
 Mark's, and about the roof and the west front wheresomebody or another painted his picture of the bronze horses
The pigeons get to recognize people personally, and grow more intimateevery time we come
 I even conceive they make favorites, for I had threepecking food out of my mouth to-day and refusing to take it in any otherfashion, and they coo and say thank you before and after every seed theytake or spill
 They are quite the pleasantest of all the Italianbeggars--and the cleanest
Your friend pressed us in to tea yesterday: I think less for the sake ofgiving us tea than that we should see his palace, or rather his firstfloor, in which alone he seems to lose himself
 I have no idea formeasurements, but I imagine his big sala is about eighty feet long andperhaps twenty-five feet across, with a flat-beamed roof, windows ateach end, and portières along the walls of old blue Venetian linen: aplace in which it seems one could only live and think nobly
 His faceseems to respond to its teachings
 What more might not an environmentlike that bring out in you? Come and let me see! I have hopes springingas I think of things that you may be coming after all; and that that iswhat lay concealed under the gayety of your last paragraph
 Then I ammore blessed even than I knew
 What, you are coming? So well I do loveyou, my Beloved!LETTER XLI
Dearest: This letter will travel with me: we leave to-day
 Ourmovements are to be too restless and uncomfortable for the next few daysfor me to have a chance of quiet seeing or quiet writing anywhere
 AtRiva we shall rest, I hope
Yesterday a storm began coming over towards evening, and I thought tomyself that if it passed in time there should be a splendid sunset ofsmolder and glitter to be seen from the Campanile, and perhaps by goodchance a rainbow
I went alone: when I got to the top the rain was pelting hard; so thereI stayed happily weather-bound for an hour looking over Venice "silveredwith slants of rain," and watching umbrellas scuttering below with toesbeneath them
 The golden smolder was very slow in coming: it lay overthe mainland and came creeping along the railway track
 Then came theglitter and the sun, and I turned round and found my rainbow
 But itwasn't a bow, it was a circle: the Campanile stood up as it were aspoke in the middle,--the lower curve of the rainbow lay on the groundof the Piazzetta, cut off sharp by the shadow of the Campanile
 It wasworth waiting an hour to see
 The islands shone mellow and bright in theclearance with the storm going off black behind them
 Good-by, Venice!       *       *       *       *       *Verona began by seeming dull to me; but it improves and unfolds beautifulcorners of itself to be looked at: only I am given so little time
 TheTombs of the Della Scalas and the Renaissance façade of the Consiglio arewhat chiefly delight me
 I had some quiet hours in the Museo, where I fellin love with a little picture by an unknown painter, of Orpheus charmingthe beasts in a wandering green landscape, with a dance of fauns in thedistance, and here and there Eurydice running;--and Orpheus in Hades, andthe Thracian women killing him, and a crocodile fishing out his head, andmermaids and ducks sitting above their reflections reflecting
Also there is one beautiful Tobias and the Angel there by a painterwhose name I most ungratefully forget
 I saw a man yesterday carryingfishes in the market, each strung through the gills on a twig of myrtle:that is how Tobias ought to carry his fish: when a native customsuggests old paintings, how charming it always is!    Riva
We have just got here from Verona
 In the matter of the garden at leastit is a Paradise of a place
 A great sill of honeysuckle leans out frommy window: beyond is a court grown round with creepers, and beyond thatthe garden--such a garden! The first thing one sees is an arcade ofvines upon stone pillars, between which peep stacks of roses, going offa little from their glory now, and right away stretches an alley ofgreen, that shows at the end, a furlong off, the blue glitter of water
It is a beautifully wild garden: grass and vegetables and trees androses all grow in a jungle together
 There are little groves of bambooand chestnut and willow; and a runnel of water is somewhere--I can hearit
 It suggests rest, which I want; and so, for all its difference,suggests you, whom also I want,--more, I own it now, than I have said!But that went without saying, Beloved, as it always must if it is to bethe truth and nothing short of the truth
While this has been waiting to go, your letter has been put into my hands
I am too happy to say words about it, and can afford now to let this go asit is
 The little time of waiting for you will be perfect happiness now;and your coming seems to color all that is behind as well
 I have had agood time indeed, and was only wearying with the plethora of my enjoyment:but the better time has been kept till now
 We shall be together day afterday and all day long for at least a month, I hope: a joy that has neverhappened to us yet
Never mind about the lost letter now, dearest, dearest: Venice was alittle empty just one week because of it
 I still hope it will come; butwhat matter?--I know _you_ will
 All my heart waits for you
--Your mostglad and most loving
LETTER XLII
Dearest: I saw an old woman riding a horse astride: and I was convinced onthe spot that this is the rightest way of riding, and that the sidesaddlewas a foolish and affected invention
 The horse was fine, and so was theyoung man leading it: the old woman was upright and stately, with a widehat and full petticoats like a Maximilian soldier
This was at Bozen, where we stayed for two nights, and from which I havebrought a cold with me: it seems such an English thing to have, that Ifeel quite at home in the discomfort of it
 It had been such wonderfulweather that we were sitting out of doors every evening up to 9

We go on to Zurich on Thursday, and then, Beloved, and then!--so thismust be my last letter, since I shall have nowhere to write to with yourushing all across Europe and resting nowhere because of my impatienceto have you
 The Mother-Aunt concedes a whole month, but Arthur willhave to leave earlier for the beginning of term
 How little my twodearest men have yet seen of each other! Barely a week lies between us:this will scarcely catch you
 Dearest of dearests, my heart waits onyours
LETTER XLIII
My Dearest: See what an effect your "gallous young hound" episode has hadon me
 I send it back to you roughly done into rhyme
 I don't knowwhether it will carry; for, outside your telling of it, "Johnnie Kigarrow"is not a name of heroic sound
 What touches me as so strangely completeabout it is that you should have got that impression and momentaryromantic delusion as a child, and now hear, years after, of hisdisappearing out of life thus fittingly and mysteriously, so that his namewill fix its legend to the countryside for many a long day
 I would liketo go there some day with you, and standing on Twloch Hill imagine all thecountry round as the burial-place of the strong man on whose knees mybeloved used to play when a child
It must have been soon after this that your brother died: truly,dearest, from now, and strangely, this Johnnie Kigarrow will seem moreto me than him; touching a more heroic strain of idea, and stiffeningfibers in your nature that brotherhood, as a rule, has no bearing on
A short letter to-day, Beloved, because what goes with it is so long
This is the first time I have come before your eyes as anything but aletter-writer, and I am doubtful whether you will care to have so muchall about yourself
 Yet for that very reason think how much I loveddoing it! I am jealous of those days before I knew you, and want to haveall their wild-honey flavor for myself
 Do remember more, and tell me!Dearest heart, it was to me you were coming through all your scampersand ramblings; no wonder, with that unknown good running parallel, thatmy childhood was a happy one
 May long life bless you, Beloved!(_Inclosure
_)    My brother and I were down in Wales,    And listened by night to the Welshman's tales;    He was eleven and I was ten
    We sat on the knees of the farmer's men    After the whole day's work was done:    And I was friends with the farmer's son
    His hands were rough as his arms were strong,    His mouth was merry and loud for song;    Each night when set by the ingle-wall    He was the merriest man of them all
    I would catch at his beard and say    All the things I had done in the day--    Tumbled bowlders over the force,    Swum in the river and fired the gorse--    "Half the side of the hill!" quoth I:--    "Ah!" cried he, "and didn't you die?"    "Chut!" said he, "but the squeak was narrow!    Didn't you meet with Johnnie Kigarrow?"    "No!" said I, "and who will he be?    And what will be Johnnie Kigarrow to me?"    The farmer's son said under his breath,    "Johnnie Kigarrow may be your death    Listen you here, and keep you still--    Johnnie Kigarrow bides under the hill;    Twloch barrow stands over his head;    He shallows the river to make his bed;    Bowlders roll when he stirs a limb;    And the gorse on the hills belongs to him!    And if so be one fires his gorse,    He's out of his bed, and he mounts his horse
    Off he sets: with the first long stride    He is halfway over the mountain side:    With his second stride he has crossed the barrow,    And he has you fast, has Johnnie Kigarrow!"    Half I laughed and half I feared;    I clutched and tugged at the strong man's beard,    And bragged as brave as a boy could be--    "So? but, you see, he didn't catch me!"    Fear caught hold of me: what had I done?    High as the roof rose the farmer's son:    How the sight of him froze my marrow!    "I," he cried, "am Johnnie Kigarrow!"    Well, you wonder, what was the end?    Never forget;--he had called me "friend"!    Mighty of limb, and hard, and blown;    Quickly he laughed and set me down
    "Heh!" said, he, "but the squeak was narrow,    Not to be caught by Johnnie Kigarrow!"    Now, I hear, after years gone by,    Nobody knows how he came to die
    He strode out one night of storm:    "Get you to bed, and keep you warm!"    Out into darkness so went he:    Nobody knows where his bones may be
    Only I think--if his tongue let go    Truth that once,--how perhaps _I_ know
    Twloch river, and Twloch barrow,    Do you cover my Johnnie Kigarrow?LETTER XLIV
Dearest: I have been doing something so wise and foolish: mentally wise,I mean, and physically foolish
 Do you guess?--Disobeying your partinginjunction, and sitting up to see eclipses
It was such a luxury to do as I was _not_ told just for once; to feelthere was an independent me still capable of asserting itself
 My beliefis that, waking, you hold me subjugated: but, once your godhead has puton its spiritual nightcap, and begun nodding, your mesmeric influencerelaxes
 Up starts resolution and independence, and I breathe desolatelyfor a time, feeling myself once more a free woman
'Twas a tremulous experience, Beloved; but I loved it all the more forthat
 How we love playing at grief and death--the two things that mustcome--before it is their due time! I took a look at my world for threemost mortal hours last night, trying to see you _out_ of it
 And oh, howclose it kept bringing me! I almost heard you breathe, and was foreverwondering--Can we ever be nearer, or love each other more than we do?For _that_ we should each want a sixth sense, and a second soul: and itwould still be only the same spread out over larger territory
 I preferto keep it nesting close in its present limitations, where it feels likea "growing pain"; children have it in their legs, we in our hearts
I am growing sleepy as I write, and feel I am sending you a dullletter,--my penalty for doing as you forbade
I sat up from half-past one to a quarter to five to see our shadow goover heaven
 I didn't see much, the sky was too piebald: but I was notdisappointed, as I had never watched the darkness into dawn like thatbefore: and it was interesting to hear all the persons awaking:--cocksat half-past four, frogs immediately after, then pheasants and variousothers following
 I was cuddled close up against my window, throned in abig arm-chair with many pillows, a spirit-lamp, cocoa, bread and butter,and buns; so I fared well
 Just after the pheasants and the firstquerulous fidgetings of hungry blackbirds comes a soft pattering alongthe path below: and Benjy, secretive and important, is fussing his wayto the shrubbery, when instinct or real sentiment prompts him to look upat my window; he gives a whimper and a wag, and goes on
 I try topersuade myself that he didn't see me, and that he does this, othermornings, when I am not thus perversely bolstered up in rebellion, andpeering through blinds at wrong hours
 Isn't there something pathetic inthe very idea that a dog may have a behind-your-back attachment of thatsort?--that every morning he looks up at an unresponsive blank, andwags, and goes by?I heard him very happy in the shrubs a moment after: he and a pheasant,I fancy, disputing over a question of boundaries
 And he comes in forbreakfast, three hours later, looking positively _fresh,_ and wants toknow why I am yawning
Most mornings he brings your letter up to my room in his mouth
 It isold Nan-nan's joke: she only sends up _yours_ so, and pretends it isBenjy's own clever selection
 I pretend that, too, to him; and he thinkshe is doing something wonderful
 The other morning I was--well, Benjyhears splashing: and tires of waiting--or his mouth waters
 An extra canof hot water happens to stand at the door; and therein he deposits histreasure (mine, I mean), and retires saying nothing
 The consequence is,when I open three minutes after his scratch, I find you all ungummed andswimming, your beautiful handwriting bleared and smeared, so that no eyebut mine could have read it
 Benjy's shame when I showed him what hehad done was wonderful
How it rejoices me to write quite foolish things to you!--that I _can_helps to explain a great deal in the up-above order of things, which Inever took in when I was merely young and frivolous
 One must havetouched a grave side of life before one can take in that Heaven is notopposed to laughter
My eye has just caught back at what I have written; and the "littledeath" runs through me, just because I wrote "grave side
" It shouldn't,but loving has made me superstitious: the happiness seems too great; howcan it go on? I keep thinking--this is not life: you are too much forme, my dearest!Oh, my Beloved, come quickly to meet me to-day: this morning! Ride over;I am willing it
 My own dearest, you must come
 If you don't, what shallI believe? That Love cannot outdo space: that when you are away I cannotreach you by willing
 But I can: come to me! You shall see my arms opento you as never before
 What is it?--you must be coming
 I have morelove in me after all than I knew
Ah, I know: I wrote "grave side," and all my heart is in arms againstthe treason
 With us it is not "till death us do part": we leap italtogether, and are clasped on the other side
My dear, my dear, I lay my head down on your heart: I love you! I postthis to show how certain I am
 At twelve to-day I shall see you
LETTER XLV
Beloved: I look at this ridiculous little nib now, running like a plowalong the furrows! What can the poor thing do? Bury its poor black, bluntlittle nose in the English language in order to tell you, in all sorts ofroundabout ways, what you know already as well as I do
 And yet, thoughthat is all it can do, you complain of not having had a letter! Not had aletter? Beloved, there are half a hundred I have not had from you! Do yousuppose you have ever, any one week in your life, sent me as many as Iwanted?Now, for once, I did hold off and didn't write to you: because there wassomething in your last I couldn't give any answer to, and I hoped youwould come yourself before I need
 Then I hoped silence would bring you:and now--no!--instead of your dear peace-giving face I get this complaint!Ah, Beloved, have you in reality any complaint, or sorrow that I can setat rest? Or has that little, little silence made you anxious? I do cometo think so, for you never flourish your words about as I do: so,believing that, I would like to write again differently; only it is truerto let what I have written stand, and make amends for it in all haste
 Ilove you so infinitely well, how could even a year's silence give you anydoubt or anxiety, so long as you knew I was not ill?"Should one not make great concessions to great grief even when it isunreasonable?" I cannot answer, dearest: I am in the dark
 Great griefcannot be great without reasons: it should give them, and you should judgeby them:--you, not I
 I imagine you have again been face to face withfierce, unexplained opposition
 Dearest, if it would give you happiness, Iwould say, make five, ten, twenty years' "concession," as you call it
 Butthe only time you ever spoke to me clearly about your mother's mind towardme, you said she wanted an absolute surrender from you, not covered onlyby her lifetime
 Then though I pitied her, I had to smile
 A twenty years'concession even would not give rest to her perturbed spirit
 I praytruly--having so much reason for your sake to pray it--"God rest her soul!and give her a saner mind toward both of us
"Why has this come about at all? It is not February yet: and _our_ planshave been putting forth no buds before their time
 When the day comes,and you have said the inevitable word, I think more calm will followthan you expect
 _You_, dearest, I do understand: and the instinct oftenderness you have toward a claim which yet fills you with the sense ofits injustice
 I know that you can laugh at her threat to make you poor;but not at hurting her affections
 Did your asking for an "answer" meanthat I was to write so openly? Bless you, my own dearest
LETTER XLVI
Dearest: To-day I came upon a strange spectacle: poor old Nan-nan weepingfor wounded pride in me
 I found her stitching at raiment of needleworkthat is to be mine (piles of it have been through her fingers since theword first went out; for her love asserts that I am to go all home-madefrom my old home to my new one--wherever that may be!)
 And she wasweeping because, as I slowly got to understand, from one particularquarter too little attention had been paid to me:--the kow-tow of aceremonious reception into my new status had not been deep enough tomake amends to her heart for its partial loss of me
Her deferential recognition of the change which is coming is patheticand full of etiquette; it is at once so jealous and so unselfish
Because her sense of the proprieties will not allow her to do so muchlonger, she comes up to my room and makes opportunity to scold me overquite slight things:--and there I am, meeker under her than I would beto any relative
 So to-day I had to bear a statement of your mother'sinfirmities rigorously outlined in a way I could only pretend to be deafto until she had done
 Then I said, "Nan-nan, go and say your prayers!"And as she stuck her heels down and refused to go, there I left the poorthing, not to prayer, I fear, but to desolate weeping, in which love andpride will get more firmly entangled together than ever
I know when I go up to my room next I shall find fresh flowers put uponmy table: but the grievous old dear will be carrying a sore heart that Icannot comfort by any words
 I cannot convince her that I am not hidingin myself any wounds such as she feels on my behalf
I write this, dearest, as an indirect answer to yours,--which is butNan-nan's woe writ large
 If I could persuade your two dear and verydifferent heads how very slightly wounded I am by a thing which a littlewaiting will bring right, I could give it even less thought than I do
Are you keeping the truce in spirit when you disturb yourself like this?Trust me, Beloved, always to be candid: I will complain to you when Ifeel in need of comfort
 Be comforted yourself, meanwhile, and don'tshape ghosts of grief which never do a goose-step over me! Ah well,well, if there is a way to love you better than I do now, only show itme! Meantime, think of me as your most contented and happy-go-loving
LETTER XLVII
Dearest: I am haunted by a line of quotation, and cannot think where itcomes from:    "Now sets the year in roaring gray
"Can you help me to what follows? If it is a true poem it ought now to beable to sing itself to me at large from an outer world which at thismoment is all gray and roaring
 To-day the year is bowing itself outtempestuously, as if angry at having to go
 Dear golden year! I am sorryto see its face so changed and withering: it has held so much for usboth
 Yet I am feeling vigorous and quite like spring
 All the seasonshave their marches, with buffetings and border-forays: this is an autumnmarch-wind; before long I shall be out into it, and up the hill to lookover at your territory and you being swept and garnished for the sevendevils of winter
"Roaring gray" suggests Tennyson, whom I do very much associate withthis sort of weather, not so much because of passages in "Maud" and "InMemoriam" as because I once went over to Swainston, on a day such asthis when rooks and leaves alike hung helpless in the wind; and heardthere the story of how Tennyson, coming over for his friend's funeral,would not go into the house, but asked for one of Sir John's old hats,and with that on his head sat in the garden and wrote almost the best ofhis small lyrics:    "Nightingales warbled without,     Within was weeping for thee
"The "old hat" was mentioned as something humorous: yet an old glove isthe most accepted symbol of faithful absence: and why should head ranklower than hand? What creatures of convention we are!There is an old notion, quite likely to be true, that a nightcap carriesin it the dreams of its first owner, or that anything laid over asleeper's head will bring away the dream
 One of the stories which usedto put a lump in my throat as a child was of an old backwoodsman who bythat means found out that his dog stole hams from the storeroom
 The dogwas given away in disgrace, and came to England to die of a broken heartat the sight of a cargo of hams, which, at their unpacking, seemed likea monstrous day of judgment--the bones of his misdeeds rising againreclothed with flesh to reproach him with the thing he had neverforgotten
I wonder how long it was before I left off definitely choosing out astory for the pleasure of making myself cry! When one begins to avoidthat luxury of the fledgling emotions, the first leaf of youth is flown
To-day I look almost jovially at the decay of the best year I have everlived through, and am your very middle-aged faithful and true
LETTER XLVIII
Dearest: If anybody has been "calling me names" that are not mine, they dome a fine injury, and you did well to purge the text of their abuse
 Iagree with no authority, however immortal, which inquires "What's in aname?" expecting the answer to be a snap of the fingers
 I answer with asnap of temper that the blood, boots, and bones of my ancestors are inmine! Do you suppose I could have been the same woman had such names asAmelia or Bella or Cinderella been clinging leechlike to my consciousnessthrough all the years of my training? Why, there are names I can think ofwhich would have made me break down into side-ringlets had I been forcedto wear them audibly
The effect is not so absolute when it is a second name that can be tuckedaway if unpresentable, but even then it is a misfortune
 There is C----,now, who won't marry, I believe, chiefly because of the insane "Annie"with which she was smitten at the baptismal font by an afterthought
 Sheregards it as a taint in her constitution which orders her to a lonelylife lest worse might follow
 And apply the consideration more publicly:do you imagine the Prince of Wales will be the same sort of king if, whenhe comes to the throne, he calls himself King Albert Edward in floridContinental fashion, instead of "Edward the Seventh," with a right hopethat an Edward the Eighth may follow after him, to make a neck-and-neckrace of it with the Henries? I don't know anything that would do more toknit up the English constitution: but whenever I pass the Albert MemorialI tremble lest filial piety will not allow the thing to be done
Now of all this I had an instance in the village the day before yesterday
At the corner house by the post-office, as I went by, a bird opened hisbill and sang a note, and down, down, down, down he went over a goldenscale: pitched afresh, and dropped down another; and then up, up, up, overthe range of both
 Then he flung back his shaggy head and laughed
 "In allmy father's realm there are no such bells as these!" It was the laughingjackass
 "Who gave you your name?" "My godfathers and my godmothers in mybaptism
" Well, _his_ will have _that_ to answer for, however safely forthe rest he may have eschewed the world, the flesh, and the devil
 Poorbird, to be set to sing to us under such a burden:--of which, unconsciousfailure, he knows nothing
Here I have remembered for you a bit of a poem that took hold of me somewhile ago and touched on the same unkindness: only here the flower isconscious of the wrong done to it, and looks forward to a day of justerjudgment:--    "What have I done?--Man came     (There's nothing that sticks like dirt),     Looked at me with eyes of blame,     And called me 'Squinancy-wort!'     What have I done? I linger     (I cannot say that I live)     In the happy lands of my birth;     Passers-by point with the finger:     For me the light of the sun     Is darkened
 Oh, what would I give     To creep away, and hide my shame in the earth!     What have I done?     Yet there is hope
 I have seen     Many changes since I began
     The web-footed beasts have been     (Dear beasts!)--and gone, being part of some wider plan
     Perhaps in His infinite mercy God will remove this man!"Now I am on sentiment and unjust judgments: here is another instance,where evidently in life I did not love well enough a character nobler thanthis capering and accommodating boy Benjy, who toadies to all my moods
Calling at the lower farm, I missed him whom I used to nickname "Manger,"because his dog-jaws always refused to smile on me
 His old mistress gaveme a pathetic account of his last days
 It was the muzzling order thatbroke his poor old heart
 He took it as an accusation on a point where,though of a melancholy disposition, his reputation had been spotless
 Henever lifted his head nor smiled again
 And not all his mistress' lovecould explain to him that he was not in fault
 She wept as she told it me
Good-by, dearest, and for this letter so full of such little worth call mewhat names you like; and I will go to Jemima, Keziah, and Kerenhappuch forthe patience in which they must have taken after their father when he sonamed them, I suppose for a discipline
My Beloved, let my heart come where it wants to be
 Twilight has been onme to-day, I don't know why; and I have not written it off as I hoped todo
--All yours and nothing left
LETTER XLIX
Dearest: I suppose your mother's continued absence, and her unexplanationof her further stay, must be taken for unyielding disapproval, and tellsus what to expect of February
 It is not a cordial form of "truce": butsince it lets me see just twice as much of you as I should otherwise, Iwill not complain so long as it does not make you unhappy
 You write toher often and kindly, do you not?Well, if this last letter of hers frees you sufficiently, it is quitesettled at this end that you are to be with us for Christmas:--read intothat the warmest corners of a heart already fully occupied
 I do not thinkof it too much, till I am assured it is to be
Did you go over to Pembury for the day? Your letter does not say anything:but your letters have a wonderful way with them of leaving out things ofoutside importance
 I shall hear from the rattle of returning fire-enginessome day that Hatterling has been burned down: and you will arrive coolthe next day and say, "Oh yes, it is so!"I am sure you have been right to secure this pledge of independence toyourself: but it hurts me to think what a deadly offense it may be both toher tenderness for you and her pride and stern love of power
 To realizesuddenly that Hatterling does not mean to you so much as the power to beyour own master and happy in your own way, which is altogether opposite to_her_ way, will be so much of a blow that at first you will be able to donothing to soften it
February fill-dyke is likely to be true to its name, this coming one, inall that concerns us and our fortunes
 Meanwhile, if at Pembury youbrought things any nearer settlement, and are not coming so soon asto-morrow, let me know: for some things of "outside importance" do affectme unfavorably while in suspense
 I have not your serene determination toabide the workings of Kismet when once all that can be done is done
The sun sets now, when it does so visibly, just where Pembury _is_
 Itake it as an omen
 In your diary to-morrow you may write down in thebusiness column that you have had a business letter from _me_, or asnear to one as I can go:--chiefly for that it requires an answer on thismatter of "outside importance," which otherwise you will altogetherleave out
 But you will do better still to come
 My whole heart goes outto fetch you: my dearest dear, ever your own
LETTER L
Beloved: No, not Browning but Tennyson was in my thoughts at our last ridetogether: and I found myself shy, as I have been for a long time wishingto say things I could not
 What has never entered your head to ask becomesdifficult when I wish to get it spoken
 So I bring Tennyson to tell youwhat I mean:--    "Dosn't thou 'ear my 'erse's legs, as they canters awaäy?     Proputty, proputty, proputty--that's what I 'ears 'em saäy
"The tune of this kept me silent all the while we galloped: this andPembury, a name that glows to me now like the New Jerusalem
And do you understand, Beloved? or must I say more? My freedom has madeits nest under my uncle's roof: but I _am_ a quite independent person inother ways besides character
Well, Pembury was settled on your own initiative: and I looked on proudand glad
 Now I have my own little word to add, merely a tail that wagsand makes merry over a thing decided and done
 Do you forgive me forthis: and for the greater offense of being quite shy at having to writeit?My Aunt thanks you for the game: for my part I cannot own that it willtaste sweeter to me for being your own shooting
 And please, whateverelse you do big and grand and dangerous, respect my superstitions anddon't shoot any larks this winter
 In the spring I would like to thinkthat here or there an extra lark bubbles over because I and my whimsfind occasional favor in your sight
 When I ask great favors you alwaysgrant them; and so, Ahasuerus, grant this little one to your beautifullyloving
       *       *       *       *       *Give me the credit of being conscious of it, Beloved: postscripts Inever _do_ write
 I am glad you noticed it
 If I find anything left outI start another letter: _this_ is that other letter: it goes into thesame envelope merely for company, and signs itself yours in all state
LETTER LI
Dearest: It was so nice and comedy to see the Mother-Aunt thismorning importantly opening a letter from you all to herself with thepleasure quite unmixed by any inclosure for me, or any other letter inthe house _to_ me so far as she was aware
 I listened to you with newears, discovering that you write quite beautifully in the style which Inever get from you
 Don't, because I admire you in your more formalform, alter in your style to me
 I prefer you much, for my own part,formless: and feel nearer to your heart in an unfinished sentence thanin one that is perfectly balanced
 Still I want you to know that yourcordial warmed her dear old heart and makes her not think now that shehas let me see too much of you
 She was just beginning to worry herselfjealously into that belief the last two days: and Arthur's taking to youhelped to the same end
 Very well; I seem to understand everybody'soddities now,--having made a complete study of yours
Best Beloved, I have your little letter lying close, and feel dumb whenI try to answer
 You with your few words make me feel a small thing withall my unpenned rabble about me
 Only you do know so very well that Ilove you better than I can ever write
 This is my first letter of thenew year: will our letter-writing go on all this year, or will it, as wedearly dream, die a divine death somewhere before autumn?In any case, I am, dearest, your most happy and loving
LETTER LII
My Dearest: Arthur and the friend went off together yesterday
 I am gladthe latter stayed just long enough after you left for me to have leisureto find him out human
 Here is the whole story: he came and unbosomed tome three days ago: and he said nothing about not telling, so I tell you
As water goes from a duck's back, so go all things worth hearing from meto you
Arthur had said to him, "Come down for a week," and he had answered,"Can't, because of clothes!" explaining that beyond evening-dress he hadonly those he stood in
 "Well," said Arthur, "stand in them, then; youlook all right
" "The question is," said his friend, "can I sit down?"However, he came; and was appalled to find that a man unpacked histrunk, and would in all probability be carrying away his clothes eachnight to brush them
 He, conscious of interiors, a lining hanging inrags, and even a patching somewhere, had not the heart to let his oneand only day-jacket go down to the servants' hall to be sniffed over:and so every evening when he dressed for dinner he hid his jacketlaboriously under the permanent layers of a linen wardrobe which stoodin his room
I had all this in the frankest manner from him in the hour when hebecame human: and my fancy fired at the vision
 Graves with a fierce eyeset on duty probing hither and thither in search after the missing coat;and each night the search becoming more strenuous and the mystery morebaffling than ever
 It had a funny likeness to the Jack Raikes episodein "Evan Harrington," and pleased me the more thus cropping up in reallife
Well, I demanded there and then to be shown the subject of so muchromance and adventure: and had the satisfaction of mending it, hesitting by in his shirt-sleeves the while, and watching delighted andwithout craven apologies
I notice it is not his own set he is ashamed of, but only the moneyed,high-sniffing servant-class who have no understanding for honorablepoverty: and to be misunderstood pricks him in the thinnest of thinplaces
He told me also that he brought only three white ties to last him forseven days: and that Graves placed them out in order of freshness andcleanliness night after night:--first three new ones consecutively, thenthree once worn
 After that, on the seventh day, Graves resigned allfurther responsibility, and laid out all three of them for him to choosefrom
 On the last three days of his stay he did me the honor to leave hiscoat out, declaring that my mendings had made it presentable before anemperor
 Out of this dates the whole of his character, and I understand,what I did not, why Arthur and he get on together
Now the house is empty, and your comings will be--I cannot say morewelcome: but there will be more room for them to be after my own heart
Heaven be over us both
 Faithfully your most loving
LETTER LIII
Beloved: I wish you could have been with me to look out into this gardenlast night when the spirit moved me there
 I had started for bed, butbecame sensitive of something outside not normal
 Whether my ear missedthe usual echoes and so guessed a muffled world I do not know
 To open thedoor was like slicing into a wedding-cake; then,--where was I to put afoot into that new-laid carpet of ankle-deepness? I hobbled out in a pairof my uncle's
 I suppose it is because I know every tree and shrub in itstrue form that snow seems to pile itself nowhere as it does here: itbecomes a garden of entombments
 Now and then some heap would shufflefeebly under its shroud, but resurrection was not to be: the Lawsoncypress held out great boxing-glove hands for me to shake and set free;and the silence was wonderful
 I padded about till I froze: this morning Ican see my big hoof-marks all over the place, and Benjy has beenscampering about in them as if he found some flavor of me there
 The treesare already beginning to shake themselves loose, and the spell is over:but it had a wonderful hold while it lasted
 I take a breath back intolast night, and feel myself again full of a romance without words that Icannot explain
 If you had been there, even, I think I could haveforgotten I had you by me, the place was so weighed down with its sense ofsolitude
 It struck eleven while I was outside, and in that, too, I couldhear a muffle as if snow choked all the belfry lattices and lay even onthe outer edge of the bell itself
 Across the park there are dead boughscracking down under the weight of snow; and it would be very like you totramp over just because the roads will be so impossible
I heard yesterday a thing which made me just a little more free and easyin mind, though I had nothing sensibly on my conscience
 Such a good youthwho two years ago believed I was his only possible future happiness, isnow quite happy with a totally different sort of person
 I had a littleletter from him, shy and stately, announcing the event
 I thought it sucha friendly act, for some have never the grace to unsay their grievances,however much actually blessed as a consequence of them
With that off my mind I can come to you swearing that there have been noaccidents on anybody's line of life through a mistake in signals, or aflying in the face of them, where I have had any responsibility
 As foryou, and as you know well by now, my signals were ready and waitingbefore you sought for them
 "Oh, whistle, and I'll come to you!" wastheir giveaway attitude
I am going down to play snowballs with Benjy
 Good-by
 If you come youwill find this letter on the hall table, and me you will probably hearbarking behind the rhododendrons
--So much your most loving
LETTER LIV
Beloved: We have been having a great day of tidyings out, rummagingthrough years and years of accumulations--things quite useless but which Ihave not liked to throw away
 My soul has been getting such dusty answersto all sorts of doubtful inquiries as to where on earth this, that, andthe other lay hidden
 And there were other things, the memory of which hadlain quite dead or slept, till under the light of day they sprouted hackinto life like corn from the grave of an Egyptian mummy
Very deep in one box I found a stealthy little collection of secretplaythings which it used to be my fond belief that nobody knew of butmyself
 It may have been Anna's graspingness, when four years ofseniority gave her double my age, or Arthur's genial instinct fordestructiveness, which drove me into such deep concealment of my dearestidols
 But, whether for those or more mystic reasons, I know I had dollswhich I nursed only in the strictest privacy and lavished my firmestlove upon
 It was because of them that I bore the reproach of being buta lukewarm mother of dolls and careless of their toilets; the truthbeing that my motherly passion expended itself in secret on certainoutcasts of society whom others despised or had forgotten
 They, ontheir limp and dissolute bodies, wore all the finery I could find topile on them: and one shady transaction done on their behalf I remembernow without pangs
 There was one creature of state whom an inconsideraterelative had presented to Anna and myself in equal shares
 Of courseAnna's became more and more lionlike
 I had very little love for thebone of contention myself, but the sense of injustice rankled in me
 Soone day, at an unclothing, Anna discovered that certain undergarmentswere gone altogether away
 She sat aghast, questioned me, and, when Irefused to disgorge, screamed down vengeance from the authorities
 I wasmorally certain I had taken no more than my just share, and resolutionsat on my lips under all threats
 For a punishment the whole ownershipof the big doll was made over to Anna: I was no worse off, and was verycontented with my obstinacy
 To-day I found the beautifully wroughtbodice, which I had carried beyond reach of even the supreme court ofappeal, clothing with ridiculous looseness a rag-doll whose headtottered on its stem like an over-ripe plum, and whose legs had nodeportment at all: and am sending it off in charitable surrender toAnna to be given, bag and rag, to whichever one of the children shelikes to select
Also I found:--would you care to have a lock of hair taken from the headof a child then two years old, which, bright golden, does not match whatI have on now in the least? I can just remember her: but she is much ofa stranger to both of us
 Why I value it is that the name and date onthe envelope inclosing it are in my mother's handwriting: and I suppose_she_ loved very much the curly treasure she then put away
 Some of theother things, quite funny, I will show you the next time you come over
How I wish that vanished mite had mixed some of her play-hours withyours:--you only six miles away all the time: had one but known!--Nowgrown very old and loving, always your own
LETTER LV
Beloved: I am getting quite out of letter-writing, and it is your doing,not mine
 No sooner do I get a line from you than you rush over in personand take the answer to it out of my mouth!I have had six from you in the last week, and believe I have onlyexchanged you one: all the rest have been nipped in the bud by yourarrivals
 My pen turns up a cross nose whenever it hears you coming now,and declares life so dull as not to be worth living
 Poor dinky littleOthello! it shall have its occupation again to-day, and say just what itlikes
It likes you while you keep away: so that's said! When I make it write"come," it kicks and tries to say "don't
" For it is an industriousminion, loves to have work to do, and never complains of overhours
 Itis a sentimental fact that I keep all its used-up brethren in aninclosure together, and throw none of them away
 If once they haveridden over paper to you, I turn them to grass in their old age
 I letthis out because I think it is time you had another laugh at me
Laugh, dearest, and tell me that you have done so if you want to make mea little more happy than I have been this last day or two
 There hasbeen too much thinking in the heads of both of us
 Be empty-headed foronce when you write next: whether you write little or much, I am surealways of your full heart: but I cannot trust your brain to the samepressure: it is such a Martha to headaches and careful about so manythings, and you don't bring it here to be soothed as often as youshould--not at its most needy moments, I mean
Have you made the announcement? or does it not go till to-day? I am notsorry, since the move comes from her, that we have not to wait now tillFebruary
 You will feel better when the storm is up than when it is onlylooming
 This is the headachy period
Well
 Say "well" with me, dearest! It is going to be well: waiting hasnot suited us--not any of us, I think
 Your mother is one in a thousand,I say that and mean it:--worth conquering as all good things are
 Iwould not wish great fortune to come by too primrosy a way
 "Canst thoudraw out Leviathan with a hook?" Even so, for size, is the share of theworld which we lay claim to, and for that we must be toilers of thedeep
--Always, Beloved, your truest and most loving
LETTER LVI
My Own Own Love: You have given me a spring day before the buds begin,--the weather I have been longing for! I had been quite sad at heart thesecold wet days, really _down_;--a treasonable sadness with you stillanywhere in the world (though where in the world have you been?)
 Springseemed such a long way off over the bend of it, with you unable to come;and it seems now another letter of yours has got lost
 (Write it again,dearest,--all that was in it, with any blots that happened to come:--therewas a dear smudge in to-day's, with the whirlpool mark of your thumb quiteclear on it,--delicious to rest my face against and feel _you_ there
)And so back to my spring weather: all in a moment you gave me a wholeweek of the weather I had longed after
 For you say the sun has beenshining on you: and I would rather have it there than here if it refusesto be in two places at once
 Also my letters have pleased you
 When theydo, I feel such a proud mother to them! Here they fly quick out of thenest; but I think sometimes they must come to you broken-winged, withso much meant and all so badly put
How can we ever, with our poor handful of senses, contrive to expressourselves perfectly? Perhaps,--I don't know:--dearest, I love you! Ikiss you a hundred times to the minute
 If everything in the world weredark round us, could not kisses tell us quite well all that we wish toknow of each other?--me that you were true and brave and so beautifulthat a woman must be afraid looking at you:--and you that I was just myvery self,--loving and--no! just loving: I have no room for anythingmore! You have swallowed up all my moral qualities, I have none left: Iam a beggar, where it is so sweet to beg
--Give me back crumbs ofmyself! I am so hungry, I cannot show it, only by kissing you a hundredtimes
Dear share of the world, what a wonderful large helping of it you are tome! I alter Portia's complaint and swear that "my little body isbursting with this great world
" And now it is written and I look at it,it seems a Budge and Toddy sort of complaint
 I do thank Heaven that theGodhead who rules in it for us does not forbid the recognition of theludicrous! C---- was telling me how long ago, in her own dull Protestanthousehold, she heard a riddle propounded by some indiscreet soul who didnot understand the prudish piety which reigned there: and saw suchshocked eyes opening all round on the sound of it
 "What is it," wasasked, "that a common man can see every day but that God never sees?""His equal" is the correct answer: but even so demure and proper asupport to thistly theology was to the ears that heard it as the hand ofUzzah stretched out intrusively and deserving to be smitten
 As forC----, a twinkle of wickedness seized her, she hazarded "A joke" to bethe true answer, and was ordered into banishment by the head of thatGod-fearing household for having so successfully diagnosed the familyskeleton
As for skeletons, why your letter makes me so happy is that the onewhich has been rubbing its ribs against you for so long seems to havegiven itself a day off, or crumbled to dissolution
 And you are yourselfagain, as you have not been for many a long day
 I suppose there hasbeen thunder, and the air is cleared: and I am not to know any of thatside of your discomforts?Still I _do_ know
 You have been writing your letters with pressed lipsfor a month past: and I have been a mere toy-thing, and no helpmate toyou at all at all
 Oh, why will she not love me? I know I am lovableexcept to a very hard heart, and hers is not: it is only like yours,reserved in its expression
 It is strange what pain her prejudice hasbeen able to drop into my cup of happiness; and into yours, dearest, Ifear, even more
Oh, I love you, I love you! I am crying with it, having no words todeclare to you what I feel
 My tears have wings in them: firstsemi-detached, then detached
 See, dearest, there is a rain-stain tomake this letter fruitful of meaning!It is sheer convention--and we, creatures of habit--that tears don'tcome kindly and easily to express where laughter leaves off and asomething better begins
 Which is all very ungrammatical and entirelyme, as I am when I get off my hinges too suddenly
Amen, amen! When we are both a hundred we shall remember all this verypeaceably; and the "sanguine flower" will not look back at us lessbeautifully because in just one spot it was inscribed with woe
 And ifwe with all our aids cannot have patience, where in this midge-bittenworld is that virtue to find a standing?I kiss you--how? as if it were for the first or the last time? No, butfor all time, Beloved! every time I see you or think of you sums up myworld
 Love me a little, too, and I will be as contented as I am yourloving
LETTER LVII
Come to me! I will not understand a word you have written till you come
Who has been using your hand to strike me like this, and why do you lendit? Oh, if it is she, you do not owe her _that_ duty! Never write suchthings:--speak! have you ever found me not listen to you, or hard toconvince? Dearest, dearest!--take what I mean: I cannot write over thisgulf
 Come to me,--I will believe anything you can _say_, but I canbelieve nothing of this written
 I must see you and hear what it is youmean
 Dear heart, I am blind till I set eyes on you again! Beloved, I havenothing, nothing in me but love for you: except for that I am empty!Believe me and give me time; I will not be unworthy of the joy of holdingyou
 I am nothing if not _yours_! Tell this to whoever is deceiving you
Oh, my dearest, why did you stay away from me to write so? Come and put anend to a thing which means nothing to either of us
 You love me: how canit have a meaning?Can you not hear my heart crying?--I love nobody but you--do not knowwhat love is without you! How can I be more yours than I am? Tell me, andI will be!Here are kisses
 Do not believe yourself till you have seen me
 Oh, thepain of having to _write_, of not having your arms round me in my misery!I kiss your dear blind eyes with all my heart
--My Love's most loved andloving
LETTER LVIII
No, no, I cannot read it! What have I done that you will notcome to me? They are mad here, telling me to be calm, that I am not togo to you
 I too am out of my mind--except that I love you
 I knownothing except that
 Beloved, only on my lips will I take my dismissalfrom yours: not God himself can claim you from me till you have done methat justice
 Kiss me once more, and then, if you can, say we must part
You cannot!--Ah, come here where my heart is, and you cannot!Have I never told you enough how I love you? Dearest, I have no wordsfor all my love: I have no pride in me
 Does not this alone tellyou?--You are sending me away, and I cry to you to spare me
 Can I loveyou more than that? What will you have of me that I have not given? Oh,you, the sun in my dear heavens--if I lose you, what is left of me?Could you break so to pieces even a woman you did not love? And me you_do_ love,--you _do_
 Between all this denial of me, and all thissilence of words that you have put your name to, I see clearly that youare still my lover
--Your writing breaks with trying not to say it: yousay again and again that there is no fault in me
 I swear to you,dearest, there is none, unless it be loving you: and how can you meanthat? For what are you and I made for unless for each other? With allour difference people tell us we are alike
 We were shaped for eachother from our very birth
 Have we not proved it in a hundred days ofhappiness, which have lifted us up to the blue of a heaven higher thanany birds ever sang? And now you say--taking on you the blame for thevery life-blood in us both--that the fault is yours, and that your faultis to have allowed me to love you and yourself to love me!Who has suddenly turned our love into a crime? Beloved, is it a sin thathere on earth I have been seeing God through you? Go away from me, and Heis gone also
 Ah, sweetheart, let me see you before all my world turnsinto a wilderness! Let me know better why,--if my senses are to be emptiedof you
 My heart can never let you go
 Do you wish that it should?Bring your own here, and see if it can tell me that! Come and listen tomine! Oh, dearest heart that ever beat, mine beats so like yours thatonce together you shall not divide their sound!Beloved, I will be patient, believe me, to any words you can say: but Icannot be patient away from you
 If I have seemed to reproach you, donot think that now
 For you are to give me a greater joy than I ever hadbefore when you take me in your arms again after a week that has spelleddreadful separation
 And I shall bless you for it--for this present paineven--because the joy will be so much greater
Only come: I do not live till you have kissed me again
 Oh, my beloved,how cruel love may seem if we do not trust it enough! My trust in you hascome back in a great rush of warmth, like a spring day after frost
 Ialmost laugh as I let this go
 It brings you,--perhaps before I wake: Ishall be so tired to-night
 Call under my window, make me hear in mysleep
 I will wake up to you, and it shall be all over before the rest ofthe world wakes
 There is no dream so deep that I shall not hear you outof the midst of it
 Come and be my morning-glory to-morrow without fail
 Iwill rewrite nothing that I have written--let it go! See me out of deepwaters again, because I have thought so much of you! I have come throughclouds and thick darkness
 I press your name to my lips a thousand times
As sure as sunrise I say to myself that you will come: the sun is nottruer to his rising than you to me
Love will go flying after this till I sleep
 God bless you!--and me also;it is all one and the same wish
--Your most true, loving, and dearfaithful one
LETTER LIX
I have to own that I know your will now, at last
 Without seeing you I amconvinced: you have a strong power in you to have done that! You have toldme the word I am to say to you: it is your bidding, so I say it--Good-by
But it is a word whose meaning I cannot share
Yet I have something to tell you which I could not have dreamed if ithad not somehow been true: which has made it possible for me to believe,without hearing you speak it, that I am to be dismissed out of yourheart
--May the doing of it cost you far less pain than I am fearing!You did not come, though I promised myself so certainly that you would:instead came your last very brief note which this is to obey
 Still Iwatched for you to come, believing it still and trusting to silence onmy part to bring you more certainly than any more words could do
 Andat last either you came to me, or I came to you: a bitter last meeting
Perhaps your mind too holds what happened, if so I have got truly atwhat your will is
 I must accept it as true, since I am not to see youagain
 I cannot tell you whether I thought it or dreamed it, but itseems still quite real, and has turned all my past life into a mockery
When I came I was behind you; then you turned and I could see yourface--you too were in pain: in that we seemed one
 But when I touchedyou and would have kissed you, you shuddered at me and drew back yourhead
 I tell you this as I would tell you anything unbelievable that Ihad heard told of you behind your back
 You see I am obeying you atlast
For all the love which you gave me when I seemed worthy of it I thankyou a thousand times
 Could you ever return to the same mind, I shouldbe yours once more as I still am; never ceasing on my side to be yourlover and servant till death, and--if there be anything more--after aswell
My lips say amen now: but my heart cannot say it till breath goes out ofmy body
 Good-by: that means--God be with you
 I mean it; but He seems tohave ceased to be with me altogether
 Good-by, dearest
 I kiss your heartwith writing for the last time, and your eyes, that will see nothing morefrom me after this
 Good-by
Note
--All the letters which follow were found lying looselytogether
 They only went to their destination after the writer's death
LETTER LX
To-day, dearest, a letter from you reached me: a fallen star which hadlost its way
 It lies dead in my bosom
 It was the letter that lost itselfin the post while I was traveling: it comes now with half a dozenpostmarks, and signs of long waiting in one place
 In it you say, "We havebeen engaged now for two whole months; I never dreamed that two moonscould contain so much happiness
" Nor I, dearest! We have now beenseparated for three; and till now I had not dreamed that time could socreep, to such infinitely small purpose, as it has in carrying me from themoment when I last saw you
You were so dear to me, Beloved; _that_ you ever are! Time changesnothing in you as you seemed to me then
 Oh, I am sick to touch yourhands: all my thoughts run to your service: they seem to hear you call,only to find locked doors
If you could see me now I think you would open the door for a littlewhile
If they came and told me--"You are to see him just for five minutes, andthen part again"--what should I be wanting most to say to you? Nothing--only "Speak, speak!" I would have you fill my heart with your voice thewhole time: five minutes more of you to fold my life round
 It wouldmatter very little what you said, barring the one thing that remains neverto be said
Oh, could all this silence teach me the one thing I am longing to know!--why am I unworthy of you? If I cannot be your wife, why cannot I see youstill,--serve you if possible? I would be grateful
You meant to be generous; and wishing not to wound me, you said that"there was no fault" in me
 I realize now that you would not have saidthat to the woman you still loved
 And now I am never to know what partin me is hateful to you
 I must live with it because you would not tellme the truth!Every day tells me I am different from the thing I wish to be--yourlove, the woman you approve
I love you, I love you! Can I get no nearer to you ever for all thisstraining? If I love you so much, I must be moving toward what you wouldhave me be
 In our happiest days my heart had its growing pains,--growingto be as you wished it
Dear, even the wisest make mistakes, and the tenderest may be hardwithout knowing: I do not think I am unworthy of you, if you knew all
Writing to you now seems weakness: yet it seemed peace to come in hereand cry to you
 And when I go about I have still strength left, and tryto be cheerful
 Nobody knows, I think nobody knows
 No one in the houseis made downcast because of me
 How dear they are, and how little I canthank them! Except to you, dearest, I have not shown myself selfish
I love you too much, too much: I cannot write it
LETTER LXI
You are very ill, they tell me
 Beloved, it is such kindness inthem to have regard for the wish they disapprove and to let me know
Knowledge is the one thing needful whose lack has deprived me of myhappiness: the express image of sorrow is not so terrible as theforeboding doubt of it
 Not because you are ill, but because I knowsomething definitely about you, I am happier to-day: a little nearer toa semblance of service to you in my helplessness
 How much I wish youwell, even though that might again carry you out of my knowledge! And,though death might bring you nearer than life now makes possible, I prayto you, dearest, not to die
 It is not right that you should die yet,with a mistake in your heart which a little more life might clear away
Praying for your dear eyes to remain open, I realize suddenly how muchhope still remains in me, where I thought none was left
 Even yourillness I take as a good omen; and the thought of you weak as a childand somewhat like one in your present state with no brain for deepthinking, comes to my heart to be cherished endlessly: there you lie,Beloved, brought home to my imagination as never since the day weparted
 And the thought comes to the rescue of my helpless longing--thatit is as little children that men get brought into the kingdom ofHeaven
 Let that be the medicine and outcome of your sickness, my ownBeloved! I hold my breath with hope that I shall have word of you whenyour hand has strength again to write
 For I know that in sleeplessnights and in pain you will be unable not to think of me
 If you maderesolutions against that when you were well, they will go now that youare laid weak; and so some power will come back to me, and my heart willnever be asleep for thinking that yours lies awake wanting it:--nor everbe at rest for devising ways by which to be at the service of yourconscious longing
Ah, my own one Beloved, whom I have loved so openly and so secretly, ifyou were as I think some other men are, I could believe that I had givenyou so much of my love that you had tired of me because I had made nofavor of it but had let you see that I was your faithful subject andservant till death: so that after twenty years you, chancing upon anempty day in your life, might come back and find me still yours;--asto-morrow, if you came, you would
My pride died when I saw love looking out of your eyes at me; and it hasnot come back to me now that I see you no more
 I have no wish that itshould
 In all ways possible I would wish to be as I was when you lovedme; and seek to change nothing except as you bid me
LETTER LXII
So I have seen you, Beloved, again, after fearing that I never should
 Aday's absence from home has given me this great fortune
The pain of it was less than it might have been, since our looks did notmeet
 To have seen your eyes shut out their recognition of me would havehurt me too much: I must have cried out against such a judgment
 But youpassed by the window without knowing, your face not raised: so littlechanged, yet you have been ill
 Arthur tells me everything: he knows Imust have any word of you that goes begging
Oh, I hope you are altogether better, happier! An illness helps somepeople: the worst of their sorrow goes with the health that breaks downunder it; and they come out purged into a clearer air, and are madewhole for a fresh trial of life
I hear that you are going quite away; and my eyes bless this chance tohave embraced you once again
 Your face is the kindest I have everseen: even your silence, while I looked at you, seemed a grace insteadof a cruelty
 What kindness, I say to myself, even if it be mistakenkindness, must have sealed those dear lips not to tell me of my unworth!Oh, if I could see once into the brain of it all! No one but myself knowshow good you are: how can I, then, be so unworthy of you? Did you think Iwould not surrender to anything you fixed, that you severed us socompletely, not even allowing us to meet, and giving me no way to comeback to you though I might come to be all that you wished? Ah, dear face,how hungry you have made me!--the more that I think you are not yet sohappy as I could wish,--as I could make you,--I say it foolishly:--yet ifyou would trust me, I am sure
Oh, how tired loving you now makes me! physically I grow weary with theache to have you in my arms
 And I dream, I dream always, the shadows offormer kindness that never grow warm enough to clasp me before Iwake
--Yours, dearest, waking or sleeping
LETTER LXIII
Do you remember, Beloved, when you came on your birthday, you said I wasto give you another birthday present of your own choosing, and I promised?And it was that we were to do for the whole day what _I_ wished: you werenot to be asked to choose
You said then that it was the first time I had ever let you have yourway, which was to see me be myself independently of you:--as if such aself existed
You will never see what I write now; and I did not do then any of thethings I most wished: for first I wished to kneel down and kiss yourhands and feet; and you would not have liked that
 Even now that youlove me no more, you would not like me to do such a thing
 A woman cannever do as she likes when she loves--there is no such thing until heshows it her or she divines it
 I loved you, I loved you!--that was allI could do, and all I wanted to do
You have kept my letters? Do you read them ever, I wonder? and do theytell you differently about me, now that you see me with new eyes? Ah no,you dare not look at them: they tell too much truth! How can love-lettersever cease to be the winged things they were when they first came? I fancymine sick to death for want of your heart to rest on; but never lessloving
If you would read them again, you would come back to me
 Those littlethroats of happiness would be too strong for you
 And so you lay them ina cruel grave of lavender,--"Lavender for forgetfulness" might beanother song for Ophelia to sing
I am weak with writing to you, I have written too long: this is twiceto-day
I do not write to make myself more miserable: only to fill up my time
When I go about something definite, I can do it:--to ride, or read aloudto the old people, or sit down at meals with them is very easy; but Icannot make employment for myself--that requires too much effort ofinvention and will: and I have only will for one thing in life--to getthrough it: and no invention to the purpose
 Oh, Beloved, in the grave Ishall lie forever with a lock of your hair in my hand
 I wonder if,beyond there, one sees anything? My eyes ache to-day from the brain,which is always at blind groping for you, and the point where I missedyou
LETTER LXIV
Dearest: It is dreadful to own that I was glad at first to know that youand your mother were no longer together, glad of something that must meanpain to you! I am not now
 When you were ill I did a wrong thing: from hersomething came to me which I returned
 I would do much to undo that actnow; but this has fixed it forever
 With it were a few kind words
 I couldnot bear to accept praise from her: all went back to her! Oh, poor thing,poor thing! if I ever had an enemy I thought it was she! I do not think sonow
 Those who seem cold seldom are
 I hope you were with her at the last:she loved you beyond any word that was in her nature to utter, and theyoung are hard on the old without knowing it
 We were two people, she andI, whose love clashed jealously over the same object, and we both failed
She is the first to get rest
LETTER LXV
My Dear: I dream of you now every night, and you are always kind, alwaysjust as I knew you: the same without a shadow of change
I cannot picture you anyhow else, though my life is full of the silenceyou have made
 My heart seems to have stopped on the last beat the sightof your handwriting gave it
I dare not bid you come back now: sorrow has made me a stranger tomyself
 I could not look at you and say "I am your Star":--I could notbelieve it if I said it
 Two women have inhabited me, and the one herenow is not the one you knew and loved: their one likeness is that theyboth have loved the same man, the one certain that her love wasreturned, and the other certain of nothing
 What a world of differencelies in that!I lay hands on myself, half doubting, and feel my skeleton pushing tothe front: my glass shows it me
 Thus we are all built up: bones are atthe foundations of our happiness, and when the happiness wears thin,they show through, the true architecture of humanity
I have to realize now that I have become the greatest possible failurein life,--a woman who has lost her "share of the world": I try to shapemyself to it
It is deadly when a woman's sex, what was once her glory, reveals itselfto her as an all-containing loss
 I realized myself fully only when Iwas with you; and now I can't undo it
--You gone, I lean against ashadow, and feel myself forever falling, drifting to no end, a Francescawithout a Paolo
 Well, it must be some comfort that I do not drag youwith me
 I never believed myself a "strong" woman; your lightest wishshaped me to its liking
 Now you have molded me with your own image andsuperscription, and have cast me away
Are not the die and the coin that comes from it only two sides of thesame form?--there is not a hair's breadth anywhere between theirsurfaces where they lie, the one inclosing the other
 Yet part them, andthe light strikes on them how differently! That is a mere condition oflight: join them in darkness, where the light cannot strike, and theyare the same--two faces of a single form
 So you and I, dear, when weare dead, shall come together again, I trust
 Or are we to come back toeach other defaced and warped out of our true conjunction? I think not:for if you have changed, if soul can ever change, I shall be meltedagain by your touch, and flow to meet all the change that is in you,since my true self is to be you
Oh, you, my Beloved, do you wake happy, either with or without thoughtsof me? I cannot understand, but I trust that it may be so
 If I couldhave a reason why I have so passed out of your life, I could endure itbetter
 What was in me that you did not wish? What was in you that Imust not wish for evermore? If the root of this separation was in you,if in God's will it was ordered that we were to love, and, withoutloving less, afterwards be parted, I could acquiesce so willingly
 Butit is this knowing nothing that overwhelms me:--I strain my eyes forsight and can't see; I reach out my hands for the sunlight and am givengreat handfuls of darkness
 I said to you the sun had dropped out of myheaven
--My dear, my dear, is this darkness indeed you? Am I in the moldwith my face to yours, receiving the close impression of a misery inwhich we are at one? Are you, dearest, hungering and thirsting for me,as I now for you?I wonder what, to the starving and drought-stricken, the taste of deathcan be like! Do all the rivers of the world run together to the lipsthen, and all its fruits strike suddenly to the taste when the longdeprivation ceases to be a want? Or is it simply a ceasing of hunger andthirst--an antidote to it all?I may know soon
 How very strange if at the last I forget to think ofyou!LETTER LXVI
Dearest: Every day I am giving myself a little more pain than I need--forthe sake of you
 I am giving myself your letters to read again day by dayas I received them
 Only one a day, so that I have still something left tolook forward to to-morrow: and oh, dearest, what _unanswerable_ thingsthey have now become, those letters which I used to answer so easily!There is hardly a word but the light of to-day stands before it like adrawn sword, between the heart that then felt and wrote so, and mine as itnow feels and waits
All your tenderness then seems to be cruelty now: only _seems_, dearest,for I still say, I _do_ say that it is not so
 I know it is not so: I,who know nothing else, know that! So I look every day at one of thesemonstrous contradictions, and press it to my heart till it becomesreconciled with the pain that is there always
Indeed you loved me: that I see now
 Words which I took so much forgranted then have a strange force now that I look back at them
 You didlove: and I who did not realize it enough then, realize it now when youno longer do
And the commentary on all this is that one letter of yours which I sayover and over to myself sometimes when I cannot pray: "There is no faultin you: the fault is elsewhere; I can no longer love you as I did
 Allthat was between us must be at an end; for your good and mine the onlyright thing is to say good-by without meeting
 I know you will notforget me, but you will forgive me, even because of the great pain Icause you
 You are the most generous woman I have known
 If it wouldcomfort you to blame me for this I would beg you to do it: but I knowyou better, and ask you to believe that it is my deep misfortune ratherthan my fault that I can be no longer your lover, as, God knows, I wasonce, I dare not say how short a time ago
 To me you remain, what Ialways found you, the best and most true-hearted woman a man could prayto meet
"This, dearest, I say and say: and write down now lest you have forgottenit
 For your writing of it, and all the rest of you that I have, goeswith me to my grave
 How superstitious we are of our own bodies afterdeath!--I, as if I believed that I should ever rise or open my ears toany sound again! I do not, yet it comforts me to make sure that certainthings shall go with me to dissolution
Truly, dearest, I believe grief is a great deceiver, and that no onequite quite wishes not to exist
 I have no belief in future existence;yet I wish it so much--to exist again outside all this failure of mylife
 For at present I have done you no good at all, only evil
And I hope now and then, that writing thus to you I am not writingaltogether in vain
 If I can see sufficiently at the last to say--Sendhim these, it will be almost like living again: for surely you will loveme again when you see how much I have suffered,--and suffered because Iwould not let thought of you go
Could you dream, Beloved, reading _this_ that there is bright sunlightstreaming over my paper as I write?LETTER LXVII
Do you forgive me for coming into your life, Beloved? I do not know inwhat way I can have hurt you, but I know that I have
 Perhaps withoutknowing it we exchange salves for the wounds we have given and received?Dearest, I trust those I send reach you: I send them, wishing till I growweak
 My arms strain and become tired trying to be wings to carry them toyou: and I am glad of that weariness--it seems to be some virtue that hasgone out of me
 If all my body could go out in the effort, I think Ishould get a glimpse of your face, and the meaning of everything then atlast
I have brought in a wild rose to lay here in love's cenotaph, among allmy thoughts of you
 It comes from a graveyard full of "little deaths
" Iremember once sending you a flower from the same place when love wasstill fortunate with us
 I must have been reckless in my happiness to dothat!Beloved, if I could speak or write out all my thoughts, till I hademptied myself of them, I feel that I should rest
 But there is no_emptying_ the brain by thinking
 Things thought come to be thoughtagain over and over, and more and fresh come in their train: childrenand grandchildren, generations of them, sprung from the old stock
 Ihave many thoughts now, born of my love for you, that never came when wewere together,--grandchildren of our days of courtship
 Some of them areset down here, but others escape and will never see your face!If (poor word, it has the sound but no hope of a future life): still,IF you should ever come back to me and want, as you would want,to know something of the life in between,--I could put these lettersthat I keep into your hands and trust them to say for me that no dayhave I been truly, that is to say _willingly_, out of your heart
 WhenRichard Feverel comes back to his wife, do you remember how she takeshim to see their child, which till then he had never seen--and itslikeness to him as it lies asleep? Dearest, have I not been as true toyou in all that I leave here written?If, when I come to my finish, I get any truer glimpse of your mind, andam sure of what you would wish, I will leave word that these shall besent to you
 If not, I must suppose knowledge is still delayed, not thatit will not reach you
Sometimes I try still not to wish to die
 For my poor body's sake Iwish Well to have its last chance of coming to pass
 It is the unhappyunfulfilled clay of life, I think, which robbed of its share of thingsset ghosts to walk: mists which rise out of a ground that has not workedout its fruitfulness, to take the shape of old desires
 If I leave aghost, it will take _your_ shape, not mine, dearest: for it will be "astrees walking" that the "lovers of trees" will come back to earth
Browning did not know that
 Someone else, not Browning, has worded itfor us: a lover of trees far away sends his soul back to the countrythat has lost him, and there "the traveler, marveling why, halts on thebridge to hearken how soft the poplars sigh," not knowing that it is thelover himself who sighs in the trees all night
 That is how the ghostsof real love come back into the world
 The ghosts of love and the ghostsof hatred must be quite different: these bring fear, and those none
Come to me, dearest, in the blackest night, and I will not be afraid
How strange that when one has suffered most, it is the poets (those whoare supposed to _sing_) who best express things for us
 Yet singing is thething I feel least like
 If ever a heart once woke up to find itself fullof tune, it was mine; now you have drawn all the song out of it, emptiedit dry: and I go to the poets to read epitaphs
 I think it is theircruelty that appeals to me:--they can sing of grief! O hard hearts!Sitting here thinking of you, my ears have suddenly become wide open tothe night-sounds outside
 A night-jar is making its beautiful burr inthe stillness, and there are things going away and away, telling me thewhereabouts of life like points on a map made for the ear
 You, too, are_somewhere_ outside, making no sound: and listening for you I heardthese
 It seemed as if my brain had all at once opened and caught a newsense
 Are you there? This is one of those things which drop to us withno present meaning: yet I know I am not to forget it as long as I live
Good-night! At your head, at your feet, is there any room for me to-night,Beloved?LETTER LXVIII
Dearest: The thought keeps troubling me how to give myself to you most, ifyou should ever come back for me when I am no longer here
 These poorletters are all that I can leave: will they tell you enough of my heart?Oh, into that, wish any wish that you like, and it is there already! Myheart, dearest, only moves in the wish to be what you desire
Yet I am conscious that I cannot give, unless you shall choose to take:and though I write myself down each day your willing slave, I cry mywares in a market where there is no bidder to hear me
Dearest, though my whole life is yours, it is little you know of it
My wish would be to have every year of my life blessed by yourconsciousness of it
 Barely a year of me is all that you have, truly, toremember: though I think five summers at least came to flower, andwithered in that one
I wish you knew my whole life: I cannot tell it: it was too full ofinfinitely small things
 Yet what I can remember I would like to tellnow: so that some day, perhaps, perhaps, my childhood may here and therebe warmed long after its death by your knowledge coming to it anddiscovering in it more than you knew before
How I long, dearest, that what I write may look up some day and meet youreye! Beloved, _then_, however faded the ink may have grown, I think thespirit of my love will remain fresh in it:--I kiss you on the lips withevery word
 The thought of "good-by" is never to enter here: it is _Areviderci_ for ever and ever:--"Love, love," and "meet again!"--the wordswe put into the thrush's song on a day you will remember, when all theworld for us was a garden
Dearest, what I can tell you of older days,--little things they must be--Iwill: and I know that if you ever come to value them at all, theirlittleness will make them doubly welcome:--just as to know that you wereonce called a "gallous young hound" by people whom you plagued when a boy,was to me a darling discovery: all at once I caught my childhood'simaginary comrade to my young spirit's heart and kissed him, brow andeyes
Good-night, good-night! To-morrow I will find you some earliest memory:the dew of Hermon be on it when you come to it--if ever!Oh, Beloved, could you see into my heart now, or I into yours, timewould grow to nothing for us; and my childhood would stay unwritten!From far and near I gather my thoughts of you for the kiss I cannotgive
 Good-night, dearest
LETTER LXIX
Beloved: I remember my second birthday
 I am quite sure of it, because mythird I remember so infinitely well
--Then I was taken in to see Arthurlying in baby bridal array of lace fringes and gauze, and received in myarms held up for me by Nan-nan the awful weight and imperial importance ofhis small body
I think from the first I was told of him as my "brother": cousin I havenever been able to think him
 But all this belongs to my third: on mysecond, I remember being on a floor of roses; and they told me if Iwould go across to a clipboard and pull it open there would be somethingthere waiting for me
 And it was on all-fours that I went all eagernessacross great patches of rose-pattern, till I had butted my way through adoor left ajar, and found in a cardboard box of bright tinsel andflowers two little wax babes in the wood lying
I think they gave me my first sense of color, except, perhaps, therose-carpet which came earlier, and they remained for quite a long timethe most beautiful thing I knew
 It is strange that I cannot rememberwhat became of them, for I am sure I neither broke nor lost them,--perhapsit was done for me: Arthur came afterward, the tomb of many of my earlyjoys, and the maker of so many new ones
 He, dearest, is the one, the onlyone, who has seen the tears that belong truly to you: and he blesses mewith such wonderful patience when I speak your name, allowing that perhapsI know better than he
 And after the wax babies I had him for my thirdbirthday
LETTER LXX
Beloved: I think that small children see very much as animals must do:just the parts of things which have a direct influence on their lives, andno memory outside that
 I remember the kindness or frowns of faces inearly days far more than the faces themselves: and it is quite a distinctand later memory that I have of standing within a doorway and watching mymother pass downstairs unconscious of my being there,--and _then_, for thefirst time, studying her features and seeing in them a certain solitudeand distance which I had never before noticed:--I suppose because I hadnever before thought of looking at her when she was not concerned with me
It was this unobservance of actual features, I imagine, which made methink all gray-haired people alike, and find a difficulty in recognizingthose who called, except generically as callers--people who kissed me,and whom therefore I liked to see
One, I remember, for no reason unless because she had a brown face, Imistook from a distance for my Aunt Dolly, and bounded into the roomwhere she was sitting, with a cry of rapture
 And it was my earliestconscious test of politeness, when I found out my mistake, not to cry overit in the kind but very inferior presence to that one I had hoped for
I suppose, also, that many sights which have no meaning to children go,happily, quite out of memory; and that what our early years leave for usin the mind's lavender are just the tit-bits of life, or the first blowsto our intelligence--things which did matter and mean much
Corduroys come early into my life,--their color and the queer earthysmell of those which particularly concerned me: because I was picked upfrom a fall and tenderly handled by a rough working-man so clothed, whomI regarded for a long time afterward as an adorable object
 He and Ilived to my recognition of him as a wizened, scrubby, middle-aged man,but remained good friends after the romance was over
 I don't know whenthe change in my sense of beauty took place as regards him
Anything unusual that appealed to my senses left exaggerated marks
 Myfather once in full uniform appeared to me as a giant, so that Iscreamed and ran, and required much of his kindest voice to coax me backto him
Also once in the street a dancer in fancy costume struck me in the sameway, and seemed in his red tunic twice the size of the people whocrowded round him
I think as a child the small ground-flowers of spring took a larger holdupon me than any others:--I was so close to them
 Roses I don't remembertill I was four or five; but crocus and snowdrop seem to have been in myblood from the very beginning of things; and I remember likening thegreen inner petals of the snowdrop to the skirts of some ballet-dancingdolls, which danced themselves out of sight before I was four years old
Snapdragons, too, I remember as if with my first summer: I used to feedthem with bits of their own green leaves, believing faithfully thatthose mouths must need food of some sort
 When I became more thoughtfulI ceased to make cannibals of them: but I think I was less convincedthen of the digestive process
 I don't know when I left off feedingsnapdragons: I think calceolarias helped to break me off the habit, forI found they had no throats to swallow with
In much the same way as sights that have no meaning leave no traces, soI suppose do words and sounds
 It was many years before I overheard, inthe sense of taking in, a conversation by elders not meant for me:though once, in my innocence, I hid under the table during the elders'late dinner, and came out at dessert, to which we were always allowed tocome down, hoping to be an amusing surprise to them
 And I could not atall understand why I was scolded; for, indeed, I had _heard_ nothing atall, though no doubt plenty that was unsuitable for a child's ears hadbeen said, and was on the elders' minds when they upbraided me
Dearest, such a long-ago! and all these smallest of small things Iremember again, to lay them up for you: all the child-parentage of me whomyou loved once, and will again if ever these come to you
Bless my childhood, dearest: it did not know it was lonely of you, as Iknow of myself now! And yet I have known you, and know you still, so amthe more blest
--Good-night
LETTER LXXI
I used to stand at the foot of the stairs a long time, when by myself,before daring to start up: and then it was always the right foot that wentfirst
 And a fearful feeling used to accompany me that I was going to meetthe "evil chance" when I got to the corner
 Sometimes when I felt it wasthere very badly, I used at the last moment to shut my eyes and walkthrough it: and feel, on the other side, like a pilgrim who had comethrough the waters of Jordan
My eyes were always the timidest things about me: and to shut my eyestight against the dark was the only way I had of meeting the solitude ofthe first hour of bed when Nan-nan had left me, and before I could getto sleep
I have an idea that one listens better with one's eyes shut, and that thisand other things are a remnant of our primitive existence when perhaps theears of our arboreal ancestors kept a lookout while the rest of theirsenses slept
 I think, also, that the instinct I found in myself, and havesince in other children, to conceal a wound is a similar survival
 At onetime, I suppose, in the human herd the damaged were quickly put out ofexistence; and it was the self-preservation instinct which gave me so keena wish to get into hiding when one day I cut my finger badly--somethingmore than a mere scratch, which I would have cried over and had bandagedquite in the correct way
 I remember I sat in a corner and pretended to benursing a rag doll which I had knotted round my hand, till Nan-nannoticed, perhaps, that I looked white, and found blood flowing into mylap
 And I can recall still the overcoming comfort which fell upon me as Ilet resolution go, and sobbed in her arms full of pity for myself andscolding the "naughty knife" that had done the deed
 The rest of that dayis lost to me
Yet it is not only occasions of happiness and pain which impressthemselves
 When the mind takes a sudden stride in consciousness,--that,also, fixes itself
 I remember the agony of shyness which came on me whenstrange hands did my undressing for me once in Nan-nan's absence: thefirst time I had felt such a thing
 And another day I remember, aftercontemplating the head of Judas in a pictorial puzzle for a long time,that I seized a brick and pounded him with it beyond recognition:--thesewere the first vengeful beginnings of Christianity in me
 All my history,Bible and English, came to me through picture-books
 I wept tenderly overthe endangered eyes of Prince Arthur, yet I put out the eyes of manykings, princes, and governors who incurred my displeasure, scratching themwith pins till only a white blur remained on the paper
All this comes to me quite seriously now: I used to laugh thinking itover
 But can a single thing we do be called trivial, since out of it wegrow up minute by minute into a whole being charged with capacity forgladness or suffering?Now, as I look back, all these atoms of memory are dust and ashes that Ihave walked through in order to get to present things
 How I suffer, howI suffer! If you could have dreamed that a human body could contain somuch suffering, I think you would have chosen a less dreadful way ofshowing me your will: you would have given me a reason why I have tosuffer so
Dearest, I am broken off every habit I ever had, except my love of you
 Ifyou would come back to me you could shape me into whatever you wished
 Iwill be different in all but just that one thing
LETTER LXXII
Here in my pain, Beloved, I remember keenly now the one or two occasionswhen as a small child I was consciously a cause of pain to others
 What anirony of life that once of the two times when I remember to have beencruel, it was to Arthur, with his small astonished baby-face remaining areproach to me ever after! I was hardly five then, and going up to thenursery from downstairs had my supper-cake in my hand, only a fewmouthfuls left
 He had been having his bath, and was sitting up onNan-nan's knee being got into his bed clothes; when spying me with my cakehe piped to have a share of it
 I dare say it would not have been good forhim, but of that I thought nothing at all: the cruel impulse took me tomake one mouthful of all that was left
 He watched it go without crying;but his eyes opened at me in a strange way, wondering at this suddenlesson of the hardness of a human heart
 "All gone!" was what he said,turning his head from me up to Nan-nan, to see perhaps if she too had alike surprise for his wee intelligence
 I think I have never forgivenmyself that, though Arthur has no memory of it left in him: the judgingremembrance of it would, I believe, win forgiveness to him for any wronghe might now do me, if that and not the contrary were his way with me: sounreasonably is my brain scarred where the thought of it still lies
 Godmay forgive us our trespasses by marvelous slow ways; but we cannot alwaysforgive them ourselves
The other thing came out of a less personal greed, and was years later:Arthur and I were collecting eggs, and in the loft over one of theout-houses there was a swallow's nest too high up to be reached by anyladder we could get up there
 I was intent on getting the _eggs_, andthought of no other thing that might chance: so I spread a soft fallbelow, and with a long pole I broke the floor of the nest
 Then with asudden stir of horror I saw soft things falling along with the clay,tiny and feathery
 Two were killed by the breakage that fell with them,but one was quite alive and unhurt
 I gathered up the remnants of thenest and set it with the young one in it by the loft window where theparent-birds might see, making clumsy strivings of pity to quiet myconscience
 The parent-birds did see, soon enough: they returned, firstup to the rafters, then darting round and round and crying; then towhere their little one lay helpless and exposed, hung over it with anibbling movement of their beaks for a moment, making my miserable heartbound up with hope: then away, away, shrieking into the July sunshine
Once they came back, and shrieked at the horror of it all, and fled awaynot to return
I remained for hours and did whatever silly pity could dictate: but ofcourse the young one died: and I--_cleared away all remains that nobodymight see_! And that I gave up egg-collecting after that was no penance,but choice
 Since then the poignancy of my regret when I think of it hasnever softened
 The question which pride of life and love of make-believetill then had not raised in me, "Am I a god to kill and to make alive?"was answered all at once by an emphatic "No," which I never afterwardforgot
 But the grief remained all the same, that life, to teach me thatblunt truth, should have had to make sacrifice in the mote-hung loft ofthree frail lives on a clay-altar, and bring to nothing but pain and alast miserable dart away into the bright sunshine the spring work of twoswift-winged intelligences
 Is man, we are told to think, not worth manysparrows? Oh, Beloved, sometimes I doubt it! and would in thought give mylife that those swallows in their generations might live again
Beloved, I am letting what I have tried to tell you of my childhood endin a sad way
 For it is no use, no use: I have not to-day a glimmer ofhope left that your eyes will ever rest on what I have been at such deeptrouble to write
If I were being punished for these two childish things I did, I shouldsee a side of justice in it all
 But it is for loving you I am beingpunished: and not God himself shall make me let you go! Beloved,Beloved, all my days are at your feet, and among them days when you heldme to your heart
 Good-night; good-night always now!LETTER LXXIII
Dearest: I could never have made any appeal _from_ you to anybody: all myappeal has been _to_ you alone
 I have wished to hear reason from no otherlips but yours; and had you but really and deeply confided in me, Ibelieve I could have submitted almost with a light heart to what youthought best:--though in no way and by no stretch of the imagination can Isee you coming to me for the last time and _saying_, as you only wrote,that it was best we should never see each other again
You could not have said that with any sound of truth; and how can itlook truer frozen into writing? I have kissed the words, because youwrote them; not believing them
 It is a suspense of unbelief that youhave left me in, oh, still dearest! Yet never was sad heart truer to thefountain of all its joy than mine to yours
 You had only to see me toknow that
Some day, I dream, we shall come suddenly together, and you will see,before a word, before I have time to gather my mind back to the bodilycomfort of your presence, a face filled with thoughts of you that havenever left it, and never been bitter:--I believe never once bitter
 Foreven when I think, and convince myself that you have wronged yourself--andso, me also,--even then: oh, then most of all, my heart seems to breakwith tenderness, and my spirit grow more famished than ever for the wantof you! For if you have done right, wisely, then you have no longer anyneed of me: but if you have done wrong, then you must need me
 Oh, dearheart, let that need overwhelm you like a sea, and bring you toward me onits strong tide! And come when you will I shall be waiting
LETTER LXXIV
Dearest and Dearest: So long as you are still this to my heart I trust tohave strength to write it; though it is but a ghost of old happiness thatcomes to me in the act
 I have no hope now left in me: but I love you notless, only more, if that be possible: or is it the same love with just aweaker body to contain it all? I find that to have definitely laid off allhope gives me a certain relief: for now that I am so hopeless it becomesless hard not to misjudge you--not to say and think impatiently about youthings which would explain why I had to die like this
Dearest, nothing but love shall explain anything of you to me
 When Ithink of your dear face, it is only love that can give it its meaning
If love would teach me the meaning of this silence, I would accept allthe rest, and not ask for any joy in life besides
 For if I had themeaning, however dark, it would be by love speaking to me again at last;and I should have your hand holding mine in the darkness forever
Your face, Beloved, I can remember so well that it would be enough if Ihad your hand:--the meaning, just the meaning, why I have to sit blind
LETTER LXXV
Dearest: There is always one possibility which I try to remember in all Iwrite: even where there is no hope a thing remains _possible_:--that youreye may some day come to rest upon what I leave here
 And I would havenothing so dark as to make it seem that I were better dead than to havecome to such a pass through loving you
 If I felt that, dearest, I shouldnot be writing my heart out to you, as I do: when I cease doing that Ishall indeed have become dead and not want you any more, I suppose
 Howfar I am from dying, then, now!So be quite sure that if now, even now,--for to-day of all days hasseemed most dark--if now I were given my choice--to have known you ornot to have known you,--Beloved, a thousand times I would claim to keepwhat I have, rather than have it taken away from me
 I cannot forgetthat for a few months I was the happiest woman I ever knew: and thathappiness is perhaps only by present conditions removed from me
 If Ihave a soul, I believe good will come back to it: because I have donenothing to deserve this darkness unless by loving you: and if _by_loving you, I am glad that the darkness came
Beloved, you have the yes and no to all this: _I_ have not, and cannothave
 Something that you have not chosen for me to know, you know: itshould be a burden on your conscience, surely, not to have shared itwith me
 Maybe there is something I know that you do not
 In the way ofsorrow, I think and wish--yes
 In the way of love, I wish to think--no
Any more thinking wearies me
 Perhaps we have loved too much, and havelost our way out of our poor five senses, without having strength totake over the new world which is waiting beyond them
 Well, I wouldrather, Beloved, suffer through loving too much, than through loving toolittle
 It is a good fault as faults go
 And it is _my_ fault, Beloved:so some day you may have to be tender to it
LETTER LXXVI
Dearest: I feel constantly that we are together still: I cannot explain
When I am most miserable, even so that I feel a longing to fly out ofreach of the dear household voices which say shy things to keep mecheerful,--I feel that I have you in here waiting for me
 Heart's heart,in my darkest, it is you who speak to me!As I write I have my cheek pressed against yours
 None of it is true:not a word, not a day that has separated us! I am yours: it is only thepoor five senses part of us that spells absence
 Some day, some day youwill answer this letter which has to stay locked in my desk
 Some day,I mean, an answer will reach me:--without your reading this, your answerwill come
 Is not your heart at this moment answering me?Dearest, I trust you: I could not have dreamed you to myself, thereforeyou must be true, quite independently of me
 You as I saw you once withopen eyes remain so forever
 You cannot make yourself, Beloved, not to bewhat you are: you have called my soul to life if for no other reason thanto bear witness of you, come what may
 No length of silence can make atruth once sounded ever cease to be: borne away out of our hearing itmakes its way to the stars: dispersed or removed it cannot be lost
 I too,for truth's sake, may have to be dispersed out of my present self whichshuts me from you: but I shall find you some day,--you who made me, youwho every day make me! A part of you cut off, I suffer pain because I _am_still part of you
 If I had no part in you I should suffer nothing
 But Ido, I do
 One is told how, when a man has lost a limb, he still feelsit,--not the pleasure of it but the pain
 Dearest, are you aware of menow?Because I am suffering, you shall not think I am entirely miserable
 Buthere and now I am all unfinished ends
 Desperately I need faith at timesto tell me that each shoot of pain has a point at which it assuagesitself and becomes healing: that pain is not endurance wasted; but thatI and my weary body have a goal which will give a meaning to all this,somehow, somewhere: never, I begin to fear, here, while this body hascharge of me
Dearest, I lay my heart down on yours and cry: and having worn myselfout with it and ended, I kiss your lips and bless God that I have knownyou
I have not said--I never could say it--"Let the day perish wherein Lovewas born!" I forget nothing of you: you are clear to me,--all but onething: why we have become as we are now, one whole, parted and sentdifferent ways
 And yet so near! On my most sleepless nights my pillowis yours: I wet your face with my tears and cry, "Sleep well
"To-night also, Beloved, sleep well! Night and morning I make you myprayer
LETTER LXXVII
My own one beloved, my dearest dear! Want me, please want me! I will keepalive for you
 Say you wish me to live,--not come to you: don't say thatif you can't--but just wish me to live, and I will
 Yes, I will doanything, even live, if you tell me to do it
 I will be stronger than allthe world or fate, if you have any wish about me at all
 Wish well,dearest, and surely the knowledge will come to me
 Wish big things of me,or little things: wish me to sleep, and I will sleep better because of it
Wish anything of me: only not that I should love you better
 I can't,dearest, I can't
 Any more of that, and love would go out of my body andleave it clay
 If you would even wish _that_, I would be happy at findinga way to do your will below ground more perfectly than any I found on it
Wish, wish: only wish something for me to do
 Oh, I could rest if I hadbut your little finger to love
 The tyranny of love is when it makes nobidding at all
 That you have no want or wish left in you as regards meis my continual despair
 My own, my beloved, my tormentor and comforter,my ever dearest dear, whom I love so much!LETTER LXXVIII
To-night, Beloved, the burden of things is too much for me
Come to me somehow, dear ghost of all my happiness, and take me in yourarms! I ache and ache, not to belong to you
 I do: I must
 It is onlyour senses that divide us; and mine are all famished servants waitingfor their master
 They have nothing to do but watch for you, and pretendthat they believe you will come
 Oh, it is grievous!Beloved, in the darkness do you feel my kisses? They go out of me insharp stabs of pain: they must go _somewhere_ for me to be delivered ofthem only with so much suffering
 Oh, how this should make me hate you,if that were possible: how, instead, I love you more and more, andshall, dearest, and will till I die!I _will_ die, because in no other way can I express how much I love you
I am possessed by all the despairing words about lost happiness that thepoets have written
 They go through me like ghosts: I am haunted bythem: but they are bloodless things
 It seems when I listen to all theother desolate voices that have ever cried, that I alone have blood inme
 Nobody ever loved as I love since the world began
There, dearest, take this, all this bitter wine of me poured out until Ifeel in myself only the dregs left: and still in them is the fire andthe suffering
No: but I will be better: it is better to have known you than not
 Giveme time, dearest, to get you to heart again! I cannot leave you likethis: not with such words as these for "good-night!"Oh, dear face, dear unforgettable lost face, my soul strains up to lookfor you through the blind eyes that have been left to torment me becausethey can never behold you
 Very often I have seen you looking grieved,shutting away some sorrow in yourself quietly: but never once angry orimpatient at any of the small follies of men
 Come, then, and look at mepatiently now! I am your blind girl: I must cry out because I cannot seeyou
 Only make me believe that you yet think of me as, when you sounbelievably separated us, you said you had always found me--"thedearest and most true-hearted woman a man could pray to meet
" Beloved,if in your heart I am still that, separation does not matter
 I canwait, I can wait
I kiss your feet: even to-morrow may bring the light
 God bless you! Ipray it more than ever; because to me to-night has been so very dark
LETTER LXXIX
Dearest: I have not written to you for three weeks
 At last I am betteragain
 You seem to have been waiting for me here: always wondering when Iwould come back
 I do come back, you see
Dear heart, how are you? I kiss your feet; you are my one only happiness,my great one
 Words are too cold and cruel to write anything for me
Picture me: I am too weak to write more, but I have written this, and amso much better for it
Reward me some day by reading what is here
 I kiss, because of you, thispaper which I am too tired to fill any more
Love, nothing but love! Into every one of these dead words my heart hasbeen beating, trying to lay down its life and reach to you
LETTER LXXX
A secret, dearest, that will be no secret soon: before I am done withtwenty-three I shall have passed my age
 Beloved, it hurts me more than Ican say that the news of it should come to you from anyone but me: forthis, though I write it, is already a dead letter, lost like a predestinedsoul even in the pains that gave it birth
 Yes, it does pain me, frightensme even, that I must die all by myself, and feeling still so young
 Ithought I should look forward to it, but I do not; no, no, I would givemuch to put it off for a time, until I could know what it will mean for meas regards you
 Oh, if you only knew and _cared,_ what wild comfort Imight have in the knowledge! It seems strange that if I were going awayfrom the chance of a perfect life with you I should feel it with less painthan I feel this
 The dust and the ashes of life are all that I have tolet fall: and it is bitterness itself to part with them
How we grow to love sorrow! Joy is never so much a possession--it goesover us, incloses us like air or sunlight; but sorrow goes into us andbecomes part of our flesh and bone
 So that I, holding up my hand to thesunshine, see sorrow red and transparent like stained glass between meand the light of day, sorrow that has become inseparably mine, and isthe very life I am wishing to keep!Dearest, will the world be more bearable to you when I am out of it? It isselfish of me not to wish so, since I can satisfy you in this so soon!Every day I will try to make it my wish: or wish that it may be so whenthe event comes--not a day before
 Till then let it be more bearable thatI am still alive: grant me, dearest, that one little grace while I live!Bearable! My sorrow _is_ bearable, I suppose, because I do bear it fromday to day: otherwise I would declare it not to be
 Don't suffer as Ido, dearest, unless that will comfort you
One thing is strange, but I feel quite certain of it: when I heard that Icarried death about in me, scarcely an arm's-length away, I thoughtquickly to myself that it was not the solution of the mystery
 Othersmight have thought that it was: that because I was to die so soon,therefore I was not fit to be your wife
 But I know it was not that
 Iknow that whatever hopes death in me put an end to, you would have marriedme and loved me patiently till I released you, as I am to so soon
It is always this same woe that crops up: nothing I can ever think canaccount for what has been decreed
 That too is a secret: mine comes tomeet it
 When it arrives shall I know?And not a word, not a word of this can reach you ever! Its uses arewrung out and drained dry to comfort me in my eternal solitude
Good-night; very soon it will have to be good-by
LETTER LXXXI
Beloved: I woke last night and believed I had your arms round me, and thatall storms had gone over me forever
 The peace of your love had inclosedme so tremendously that when I was fully awake I began to think that whatI held was you dead, and that our reconciliation had come at that greatcost
Something remains real of it all, even now under the full light of day:yet I know you are not dead
 Only it leaves me with a hope that at thelesser cost of my own death, when it comes, happiness may break in, andthat whichever of us has been the most in poor and needy ignorance willknow the truth at last--the truth which is an inseparable need for allhearts that love rightly
Even now to me the thought of you is a peace passing _all_ understanding
Beloved, Beloved, Beloved, all the greetings I ever gave you gather here,and are hungry to belong to you by a better way than I have ever dreamed
I am yours, till something more than death swallows me up
LETTER LXXXII
Dearest: If you will believe any word of mine, you must not believe that Ihave died of a broken heart should science and the doctors bring about afulfillment of their present prophesyings concerning me
I think my heart has held me up for a long time, not letting me knowthat I was ill: I did not notice
 And now my body snaps on a stem thathas grown too thin to hold up its weight
 I am at the end of twenty-twoyears: they have been too many for me, and the last has seemed a uselesswaste of time
 It is difficult not to believe that great happiness mighthave carried me over many more years and built up for me in the end arenewed youth: I asked that quite frankly, wishing to know, and was toldnot to think it
So, dearest, whatever comes, whatever I may have written to fill up myworst loneliness, be sure, if you care to be, that though my life waswholly yours, my death was my own, and comes at its right natural time
Pity me, but invent no blame to yourself
 My heart has sung of you evenin the darkest days; in the face of everything, the blankness ofeverything, I mean, it has clung to an unreasoning belief that in spite ofappearances all had some well in it, above all to a conviction that--perhaps without knowing it--you still love me
 Believing _that,_ itcould not break, could not, dearest
 Any other part of me, but not that
Beloved, I kiss your face, I kiss your lips and eyes: my mind melts intokisses when I think of you
 However weak the rest of me grows, my loveshall remain strong and certain
 If I could look at you again, how in amoment you would fill up the past and the future and turn even my griefinto gold! Even my senses then would forget that they had ever beenstarved
 Dear "share of the world," you have been out of sight, but Ihave never let you go! Ah, if only the whole of me, the double doubtingpart of me as well, could only be so certain as to be able to give wingsto this and let it fly to you! Wish for it, and I think the knowledgewill come to me!Good-night! God brings you to me in my first dream: but the longing sokeeps me awake that sometimes I am a whole night sleepless
LETTER LXXXIII
I am frightened, dearest, I am frightened at death
 Not onlyfor fear it should take me altogether away from you instead of to you,but for other reasons besides,--instincts which I thought gone but amnot rid of even yet
 No healthy body, or body with power of enjoyment init, wishes to die, I think: and no heart with any desire still livingout of the past
 We know nothing at all really: we only think webelieve, and hope we know; and how thin that sort of conviction getswhen in our extremity we come face to face with the one immovable factof our own death waiting for us! That is what I have to go through
 Yeteven the fear is a relief: I come upon something that I can meet atlast; a challenge to my courage whether it is still to be found here inthis body I have worn so weak with useless lamentations
 If I had yourhand, or even a word from you, I think I should not be afraid: butperhaps I should
 It is all one
 Good-by: I am beginning at last to feela meaning in that word which I wrote at your bidding so long-ago
 Oh,Beloved, from face to feet, good-by! God be with you wherever you go andI do not!LETTER LXXXIV
Dearest: I am to have news of you
 Arthur came to me last night, and toldme that, if I wished, he would bring me word of you
 He goes to-morrow
 Heput out the light that I might not see his face: I felt what was there
You should know this of him: he has been the dearest possible of humanbeings to me since I lost you
 I am almost not unblessed when I have himto speak to
 Yet we can say so little together
 I guess all he means
 Anendless wish to give me comfort:--and I stay selfish
 The knowledge thathe would stolidly die to serve me hardly touches me
Oh, look kindly in his eyes if you see him: mine will be looking at youout of his!LETTER LXXXV
Good-morning, Beloved; there is sun shining
 I wonder if Arthur is withyou yet?If faith could still remove mountains, surely I should have seen youlong ago
 But if I were to see you now, I should fear that it meant youwere dead
That the same world should hold you and me living and unseen by eachother is a great mystery
 Will love ever explain it?I wish I could bid the sun stand still over your meeting with Arthur sothat I might know
 We were so like each other once
 Time has worn itoff: but he is like what I was
 Will you remember me well enough torecognize me in him, and to be a little pitiful to my weak longing for aword this one last time of all? Beloved, I press my lips to yours, andpray--speak!LETTER LXXXVI
Dearest: To-day Arthur came and brought me your message: I have at myheart your "profoundly grateful remembrances
" Somewhere else unansweredlies your prayer for God to bless me
 To answer that, dearest, is not inHis hands but in yours
 And the form of your message tells me it will notbe,--not for this body and spirit that have been bound together so long intruth to you
I set down for you here--if you should ever, for love's sake, sendand make claim for any message back from me--a profoundly gratefulremembrance; and so much more, so much more that has never failed
Most dear, most beloved, you were to me and are
 Now I can no longerhold together: but it is my body, not my love that has failed


 I had a parting glimpse of you, Monday forenoon, at your window--andthat image abides by me, looking pale, and not so quiet as is yourwont
 I have reproached myself many times since, because I did notshow my face, and then we should both have smiled; and so ourreminiscences would have been sunny instead of shadowy
 But I believeI was so intent on seeing you, that I forgot all about thedesirableness of being myself seen
 Perhaps, after all, you did seeme--at least you knew that I was there
 I fear that you were not quitewell that morning
 Do grow better and better--physically, I mean, forI protest against any spiritual improvement, until I am better able tokeep pace with you--but do be strong, and full of life--earthlylife--and let there be a glow in your cheeks
 And sleep soundly thewhole night long, and get up every morning with a feeling as if youwere newly created; and I pray you to lay up a stock of fresh energyevery day till we meet again; so that we may walk miles and miles,without your once needing to lean upon my arm
 Not but what youshall lean upon it, as much as you choose--indeed, whether youchoose or not--but I would feel as if you did it to lighten myfootsteps, not to support your own
 Am I requiring you to work amiracle within yourself? Perhaps so--yet, not a greater one than I doreally believe might be wrought by inward faith and outward aids
 Tryit, my Dove, and be as lightsome on earth as your sister doves are inthe air
Tomorrow I shall expect a letter from you; but I am almost in doubtwhether to tell you that I expect it; because then your consciencewill reproach you, if you should happen not to have written
 I wouldleave you as free as you leave me
 But I do wonder whether you wereserious in your last letter, when you asked me whether you wrote toooften, and seemed to think that you might thus interfere with myoccupations
 My dear Sophie, your letters are no small portion of myspiritual food, and help to keep my soul alive, when otherwise itmight languish unto death, or else become hardened and earth-incrusted,as seems to be the case with almost all the souls with whom I am indaily intercourse
 They never interfere with my worldly business--neither the reading nor the answering them--(I am speaking of yourletters, not of those "earth-incrusted" souls)--for I keep them to bethe treasure of my still and secret hours, such hours as pious peoplespend in prayer; and the communion which my spirit then holds withyours has something of religion in it
 The charm of your letters doesnot depend upon their intellectual value, though that is great, but onthe spirit of which they are the utterance, and which is a spirit ofwonderful efficacy
 No one, whom you would deem worthy of yourfriendship, could enjoy so large a share of it as I do, withoutfeeling the influence of your character throughout his own--purifyinghis aims and desires, enabling him to realise that this is a truerworld than the feverish one around us, and teaching him how to gaindaily entrance into that better world
 Such, so far as I have beenable to profit by it, has been your ministration to me
 Did you dreamwhat an angelic guardianship was entrusted to you?March 7th
 Your letter did come
 You had not the heart to disappointme, as I did you, in not making a parting visit, and shall again, bykeeping this letter to send by Mary
 But I disappoint you in these twoinstances, only that you may consider it a decree of Fate (or ofProvidence, which you please) that we shall not meet on the morningsof my departure, and that my letters shall not come oftener than onthe alternate Saturday
 If you will but believe this, you will bequiet
 Otherwise I know that the Dove will flutter her wings, andoften, by necessity, will flutter them in vain
 So forgive me, and letme have my own way, and believe (for it is true) that I never causeyou the slightest disappointment without pain and remorse on my part
And yet, I know that when you wish me to do any particular thing youwill always tell me so, and that if my sins of omission or commissionshould ever wound your heart, you will by no means conceal it
I did enjoy that walk infinitely--for certainly the enjoyment was notall finite
 And what a heavenly pleasure we might have enjoyed thisvery day; the air was so delicious, that it seemed as if the dismalold Custom House was situated in Paradise; and this afternoon, I satwith my window open, to temper the glow of a huge coal fire
 Italmost seems to me, now, as if beautiful days were wasted and thrownaway, when we do not feel their beauty and heavenliness through oneanother
     Your own friend,     N
 H
     Miss Sophia A
 Peabody,     Salem, Mass
     , April 2d, 1839     Mine own Dove,I have been sitting by my fireside ever since teatime, till now it ispast eight o'clock; and have been musing and dreaming about a thousandthings, with every one of which, I do believe, some nearer or remoterthought of you was intermingled
 I should have begun this letterearlier in the evening, but was afraid that some intrusive idler wouldthrust himself between us, and so the sacredness of my letter would bepartly lost;--for I feel as if my letters were sacred, because theyare written from my spirit to your spirit
 I wish it were possible toconvey them to you by other than earthly messengers--to convey themdirectly into your heart, with the warmth of mine still lingering inthem
 When we shall be endowed with our spiritual bodies, I think theywill be so constituted, that we may send thoughts and feelings anydistance, in no time at all, and transfuse them warm and fresh intothe consciousness of those whom we love
 Oh what a bliss it would be,at this moment; if I could be conscious of some purer feeling, somemore delicate sentiment, some lovelier fantasy, than could possiblyhave had its birth in my own nature, and therefore be aware that myDove was thinking through my mind and feeling through my heart!Try--some evening when you are alone and happy, and when you are mostconscious of loving me and being loved by me--and see if you do notpossess this power already
 But, after all, perhaps it is not wise tointermix fantastic ideas with the reality of our affection
 Let uscontent ourselves to be earthly creatures, and hold communion ofspirit in such modes as are ordained to us--by letters (dipping ourpens as deep as may be into our hearts) by heartfelt words, when theycan be audible; by glances--through which medium spirits do reallyseem to talk in their own language--and by holy kisses, which I dothink have something supernatural in them
And now good night, my beautiful Dove
 I do not write any more atpresent, because there are three more whole days before this letterwill visit you: and I desire to talk with you, each of those threedays
 Your letter did not come today
 Even if it should not cometomorrow, I shall not imagine that you forget me or neglect me, butshall heave two or three sighs, and measure salt and coal so much themore diligently
 Good night; and if I have any power, at thisdistance, over your spirit, it shall be exerted to make you sleep likea little baby, till the "Harper of the Golden Dawn" arouse you
 Thenyou must finish that ode
 But do, if you love me, sleep
April 3d
 No letter, my dearest; and if one comes tomorrow I shall notreceive it till Friday, nor perhaps then; because I have a cargo ofcoal to measure in East Cambridge, and cannot go to the Custom Housetill the job is finished
 If you had known this, I think you wouldhave done your [best] possible to send me a letter today
 Doubtlessyou have some good reason for omitting it
 I was invited to dine atMr
 Hooper's; with your sister Mary; and the notion came into my head,that perhaps you would be there,--and though I knew that it could notbe so, yet I felt as if it might
 But just as I was going home fromthe Custom House to dress, came an abominable person to say that ameasurer was wanted forthwith at East Cambridge; so over I hurried,and found that, after all, nothing would be done till tomorrow morningat sunrise
 In the meantime, I had lost my dinner, and all otherpleasures that had awaited me at Mr
 Hooper's; so that I came back invery ill humor, and do not mean to be very good-natured again, till myDove shall nestle upon my heart again, either in her own sweet person,or by her image in a letter
 But your image will be with me, longbefore the letter comes
 It will flit around me while I am measuringcoal, and will peep over my shoulder to see whether I keep a correctaccount, and will smile to hear my bickerings with the black-faceddemons in the vessel's hold, (they look like the forge-men in Retsch'sFridolin) and will soothe and mollify me amid all the pester andplague that is in store for me tomorrow
 Not that I would avoid thispester and plague, even if it were in my power to do so
 I need suchtraining, and ought to have undergone it long ago
 It will give mycharacter a healthy hardness as regards the world; while it will leavemy heart as soft--as fit for a Dove to rest upon--as it is now, orever was
 Good night again, gentle Dove
 I must leave a little spacefor tomorrow's record; and moreover, it is almost time that I wereasleep, having to get up in the dusky dawn
 Did you yield to myconjurations, and sleep well last night? Well then, I throw the samespell over you tonight
April 4th
 ½ past 9 P
M
 I came home late in the afternoon, verytired, sunburnt and sea-flushed, having walked or sat on the deck of aschooner ever since sunrise
 Nevertheless, I purified myself from thesable stains of my profession--stains which I share in common withchimney sweepers--and then hastened to the Custom House to get yourletter--for I knew there was one there awaiting me, and now I thankyou with my whole heart, and will straight way go to sleep
 Do you thesame
April 5th
 Your yesterday's letter is received, my beloved Sophie
 Ihave no time to answer it: but, like all your communications, personalor written, it is the sunshine of my life
 I have been busy all day,and am now going to see your sister Mary--and I hope, Elizabeth
 Mr
Pickens is going with me
     Miss Sophia A
 Peabody,     Salem, Mass
     Wednesday, April 17th, 1839--4 o'clock P
M
     My Dearest:If it were not for your sake, I should really be glad of this pitilesseast wind, and should especially bless the pelting rain andintermingled snowflakes
 They have released me from the toils andcares of office, and given me license to betake myself to my ownchamber; and here I sit by a good coal fire, with at least six orseven comfortable hours to spend before bed-time
 I feel pretty secureagainst intruders; for the bad weather will defend me from foreigninvasion; and as to Cousin Haley, he and I had a bitter politicaldispute last evening, at the close of which he went to bed in highdudgeon, and probably will not speak to me these three days
 Thus youperceive that strife and wrangling, as well as east winds and rain,are the methods of a kind Providence to promote my comfort--whichwould not have been so well secured in any other way
 Six or sevenhours of cheerful solitude! But I will not be alone
 I invite yourspirit to be with me--at any hour and as many hours as you please--butespecially at the twilight hour, before I light my lamp
 Are youconscious of my invitation? I bid you at that particular time, becauseI can see visions more vividly in the dusky glow of fire light, thaneither by daylight or lamplight
 Come--and let me renew my spellagainst headache and other direful effects of the east wind
 How Iwish I could give you a portion of my insensibility!--And yet I shouldbe almost afraid of some radical transformation, were I to produce achange in that respect
 God made you so delicately, that it isespecially unsafe to interfere with His workmanship
 If my littleSophie--mine own Dove--cannot grow plump and rosy and tough andvigorous without being changed into another nature then I do thinkthat for this short life, she had better remain just what she is
 Yes;but you will always be the same to me, because we have met inEternity, and there our intimacy was formed
 So get as well as youpossibly can, and be as strong and rosy as you will; for I shall neverdoubt that you are the same Sophie who have so often leaned upon myarm, and needed its superfluous strength
I was conscious, on those two evenings, of a peacefulness andcontented repose such as I never enjoyed before
 You could not havefelt such quiet unless I had felt it too--nor could I, unless you had
If either of our spirits had been troubled, they were then in suchclose communion that both must have felt the same grief and turmoil
 Inever, till now, had a friend who could give me repose;--all havedisturbed me; and whether for pleasure or pain, it was stilldisturbance, but peace overflows from your heart into mine
 Then Ifeel that there is a Now--and that Now must be always calm andhappy--and that sorrow and evil are but phantoms that seem to flitacross it
You must never expect to see my sister E
 in the daytime, unless byprevious appointment, or when she goes to walk
 So unaccustomed am Ito daylight interviews, that I never imagine her in sunshine; and Ireally doubt whether her faculties of life and intellect begin to beexercised till dusk--unless on extraordinary occasions
 Their noon isat midnight
 I wish you could walk with her; but you must not, becauseshe is indefatigable, and always wants to walk half round the world,when once she is out of doors
April 18th
 My Dove--my hopes of a long evening of seclusion were notquite fulfilled; for, a little before nine o'clock John Forresterand Cousin Haley came in, both of whom I so fascinated with mydelectable conversation, that they did not take leave till aftereleven
 Nevertheless, I had already secured no inconsiderable treasureof enjoyment, with all of which you were intermingled
 There has beennothing to do at the Custom House today; so I came home at twoo'clock, and--went to sleep! Pray Heaven you may have felt asympathetic drowsiness, and have yielded to it
 My nap has been apretty long one, for--as nearly as I can judge by the position of thesun, it must be as much as five o'clock
 I think there will be abeautiful sunset; and perhaps, if we could walk out together, the windwould change and the air grow balmy at once
 The Spring is notacquainted with my Dove and me, as the Winter was;--how then can weexpect her to be kindly to us? We really must continue to walk out andmeet her, and make friends with her; then she will salute your cheekwith her balmiest kiss, whenever she gets a chance
 As to the eastwind, if ever the imaginative portion of my brain recover from itstorpor, I mean to personify it as a wicked, spiteful, blustering,treacherous--in short, altogether devilish sort of body, whoseprinciple of life it is to make as much mischief as he can
 The westwind--or whatever is the gentlest wind of heaven--shall assume youraspect, and be humanised and angelicised with your traits ofcharacter, and the sweet West shall finally triumph over the fiendlikeEast, and rescue the world from his miserable tyranny; and if I tellthe story well, I am sure my loving and beloved West Wind will kiss mefor it
When this week's first letter came, I held it a long time in my hand,marvelling at the superscription
 How did you contrive to write it?Several times since, I have pored over it, to discover how much ofyourself was mingled with my share of it; and certainly there is agrace flung over the fac simile, which was never seen in my harsh,uncouth autograph--and yet none of the strength is lost
 You arewonderful
 Imitate this

 Your Wednesday's letter has come, dearest
 Yourletters delight me more than anything, save the sound of your voice;and I love dearly to write to you--so be at peace on that score
 Youare beautiful, my own heart's Dove
 Never doubt it again
 I shallreally and truly be very glad of the extracts; and they will have acharm for me that could not otherwise have been
 I will imagine yourvoice repeating them, tremulously
 The spell which you laid upon mybrow will retain its power till we meet again--then it must berenewed
What a beautiful day--and I had a double enjoyment of it, for yoursake and my own
 I have been to walk this afternoon, to Bunker's Hilland the Navy Yard, and am tired, because I had not your arm to supportme
God keep you from East winds and every other evil
     Mine own Dove's own Friend,     N

, 1839     My beloved,Your sweetest of all letters found me at the Custom House, where I hadalmost just arrived, having been engaged all the forenoon in measuringtwenty chaldrons of coal--which dull occupation was enlivened byfrequent brawls and amicable discussions with a crew of funny littleFrenchmen from Acadie
 I know not whether your letter was a surpriseto me--it seems to me that I had a prophetic faith that the Dove wouldvisit me--but at any rate, it was a joy, as it always is; for myspirit turns to you from all trouble and all pleasure
 This forenoon Icould not wait as I generally do, to be in solitude before openingyour letter; for I expected to be busy all the afternoon, and wasalready tired with working yesterday and today; and my heart longed todrink your thoughts and feelings, as a parched throat for cold water
So I pressed the Dove to my lips (turning my head away, so thatnobody saw me) and then broke the seal
 I do think it is the dearestletter you have written, but I think so of each successive one; so youneed not imagine that you have outdone yourself in this instance
 Howdid I live before I knew you--before I possessed your affection! Ireckon upon your love as something that is to endure when everythingthat can perish has perished--though my trust is sometimes mingledwith fear, because I feel myself unworthy of your love
 But if I amworthy of if you will always love me; and if there be anything goodand pure in me, it will be proved by my always loving you
After dinner
 I had to journey over to East Cambridge, expecting tomeasure a cargo of coal there; but the vessel had stuck in the mud onher way thither, so that nothing could be done till tomorrow morning
It must have been my guardian angel that steered her upon thatmud-bank, for I really needed rest
 Did you lead the vessel astray, myDove? I did not stop to inquire into particulars, but returned homeforthwith, and locked my door, and threw myself on the bed, with yourletter in my hand
 I read it over slowly and peacefully, and thenfolding it up, I rested my heart upon it, and fell fast asleep
Friday, May 3d

 My dearest, ten million occupations andinterruptions, and intrusions, have kept me from going on with myletter; but my spirit has visited you continually, and yours has cometo me
 I have had to be out a good deal in the east winds; but yourspell has proved sovereign against all harm, though sometimes I haveshuddered and shivered for your sake
 How have you borne it, my poordear little Dove? Have you been able to flit abroad on today's eastwind, and go to Marblehead, as you designed? You will not have seenMrs
 Hooper, because she came up to  in the cars on Mondaymorning
 I had a brief talk with her, and we made mutual inquiries,she about you, and I about little C
 I will not attempt to tell youhow it rejoices me that we are to spend a whole month together in thesame city
 Looking forward to it, it seems to me as if that monthwould never come to an end, because there will be so much of eternityin it
 I wish you had read that dream-letter through, and couldremember its contents
 I am very sure that it could not have [been]written by me, however, because I should not think of addressing youas "My dear Sister"--nor should I like to have you call mebrother--nor even should have liked it, from the very first of ouracquaintance
 We are, I trust, kindred spirits, but not brother andsister
 And then what a cold and dry annunciation of that awfulcontingency--the "continuance or not of our acquaintance
" Mine ownDove, you are to blame for dreaming such letters, or parts of letters,as coming from me
 It was you that wrote it--not I
 Yet I will notbelieve that it shows a want of faith in the steadfastness of myaffection, but only in the continuance of circumstances prosperous toour earthly and external connection
 Let us trust in GOD for that
Pray to GOD for it, my Dove--for you know how to pray better than Ido
 Pray, for my sake, that no shadows of earth may ever come betweenus, because my only hope of being a happy man depends upon thepermanence of our union
 I have great comfort in such thoughts asthose you suggest--that our hearts here draw towards one another sounusually--that we have not cultivated our friendship, but let itgrow,--that we have thrown ourselves upon one another with suchperfect trust;--and even the deficiency of worldly wisdom, that somepeople would ascribe to us in following the guidance of our hearts soimplicitly, is proof to me that there is a deep wisdom within us
 Oh,let us not think but that all will be well! And even if, to worldlyeyes, it should appear that our lot is not a fortunate one, still weshall have glimpses, at least--and I trust a pervading sunshine--of ahappiness that we could never have found, if we had unquietlystruggled for it, and made our own selection of the means and speciesof it, instead of trusting all to something diviner than our reason
My Dove, there were a good many things that I meant to have written inthis letter; but I have continually lapsed into fits of musing, andwhen I have written, the soul of my thoughts has not readily assumedthe earthly garments of language
 It is now time to carry the letterto Mary
 I kiss you, dearest--did you feel it? Your own friend,     NATH
 HAWTHORNE, ESQ
(Dear me! What an effect that Esquire gives to the whole letter!)          Salem, May 26th, 1839     Mine own Self,I felt rather dismal yesterday--a sort of vague weight on my spirit--asense that something was wanting to me here
 What or who could it havebeen that I so missed? I thought it not best to go to your house lastevening; so that I have not yet seen Elizabeth--but we shall probablyattend the Hurley-Burley tonight
 Would that my Dove might be there!It seems really monstrous that here, in her own home--or what was herhome, till she found another in my arms--she should no longer be
 Oh,my dearest, I yearn for you, and my heart heaves when I think ofyou--(and that is always, but sometimes a thought makes me know andfeel you more vividly than at others, and that I call "thinking ofyou")--heaves and swells (my heart does) as sometimes you have felt itbeneath you, when your head was resting on it
 At such moments it isstirred up from its depths
 Then our two ocean-hearts mingle theirfloods
I do not believe that this letter will extend to three pages
 Myfeelings do not, of their own accord, assume words--at least, not acontinued flow of words
 I write a few lines, and then I fall a-musingabout many things, which seem to have no connection among themselves,save that my Dove flits lightly through them all
 I feel as if mybeing were dissolved and the idea of you were diffused throughout it
Am I writing nonsense? That is for you to decide
 You know what isTruth--"what is what"--and I should not dare to say to you what I feltto be other than the Truth--other than the very "what
" It is verysingular (but I do not suppose I can express it) that, while I loveyou so dearly, and while I am so conscious of the deep embrace of ourspirits, still I have an awe of you that I never felt for anybodyelse
 Awe is not the word, either; because it might imply somethingstern in you--whereas--but you must make it out for yourself
 I dowish that I could put this into words--not so much for yoursatisfaction (because I believe you will understand) as for my own
 Isuppose I should have pretty much the same feeling if an angel were tocome from Heaven and be my dearest friend--only the angel could nothave the tenderest of human natures too, the sense of which ismingled with this sentiment
 Perhaps it is because in meeting you, Ireally meet a spirit, whereas the obstructions of earth have preventedsuch a meeting in every other place
 But I leave the mystery here
Some time or other, it may be made plainer to me
 But methinks itconverts my love into a religion
 And then it is singular, too, thatthis awe (or whatever it be) does not prevent me from feeling that itis I who have the charge of you, and that my Dove is to follow myguidance and do my bidding
 Am I not very bold to say this? And willnot you rebel? Oh no; because I possess the power only so far as Ilove you
 My love gives me the right, and your love consents to it
Since writing the above I have been asleep; and I dreamed that I hadbeen sleeping a whole year in the open air; and that while I slept,the grass grew around me
 It seemed, in my dream, that the verybed-clothes which actually covered me were spread beneath me, and whenI awoke (in my dream) I snatched them up, and the earth under themlooked black, as if it had been burnt--one square place, exactly thesize of the bedclothes
 Yet there was grass and herbage scattered overthis burnt space, looking as fresh, and bright, and dewy, as if thesummer rain and the summer sun had been cherishing them all thetime
 Interpret this for me, my Dove--but do not draw any somber omensfrom it
 What is signified [by] my nap of a whole year? (It made megrieve to think that I had lost so much of eternity)--and what was thefire that blasted the spot of earth which I occupied, while the grassflourished all around?--And what comfort am I to draw from the freshherbage amid the burnt space? But it is a silly dream, and you cannotexpound any sense out of it
 Generally, I cannot remember what mydreams have been--only there is a confused sense of having passedthrough adventures, pleasurable or otherwise
 I suspect that youmingle with my dreams, but take care to flit away just before I awake,leaving me but dimly and doubtfully conscious of your visits
Do you never start so suddenly from a dream that you are afraid tolook round the room, lest your dream-personages (so strong anddistinct seemed their existence, a moment before) should have thrustthemselves out of dream-land into the midst of realities? I do,sometimes
I wish I were to see you this evening
 How many times have you thoughtof me today? All the time?--Or not at all? Did you ever read such afoolish letter as this? (Here I was interrupted, and have taken astroll down on the Neck--a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful sunshine,and air, and sea
 Would that my Dove had been with me
 I fear that weshall perforce lose some of our mutual intimacy with Nature--we walktogether so seldom that she will seem more like a stranger
 Would thatI could write such sweet letters to mine own self, as mine own selfwrites to me
 Good bye, dearest self
 Direct yours to     NATH

     Custom-House, 
     Miss Sophia A
 Peabody,     No
 4 Avon Place,     
     , July 3d, 1839     Most beloved Amelia,I shall call you so sometimes in playfulness, and so may you; but itis not the name by which my soul recognizes you
 It knows you asSophie; but I doubt whether that is the inwardly and intensely dearestepithet either
 I believe that "Dove" is the true word after all; andit never can be used amiss, whether in sunniest gaiety or shadiestseriousness
 And yet it is a sacred word, and I should not love tohave anybody hear me use it, nor know that GOD has baptised youso--the baptism being for yourself and me alone
 By that name, Ithink, I shall greet you when we meet in Heaven
 Other dear ones maycall you "daughter," "sister," "Sophia," but when, at your entranceinto Heaven, or after you have been a little while there, you hear avoice say "Dove!" then you will know that your kindred spirit has beenadmitted (perhaps for your sake) to the mansions of rest
 That wordwill express his yearning for you--then to be forever satisfied; forwe will melt into one another, and be close, close together then
 Thename was inspired; it came without our being aware that you werethenceforth to be my Dove, now and through eternity
 I do notremember, how nor when it alighted on you; the first I knew, it was inmy heart to call you so
Good night now, my Dove
 It is not yet nine o'clock; but I am somewhataweary and prefer to muse about you till bedtime, rather than write
July 5th, ½ past seven P
M
 I must, somehow or other, finish thisletter tonight, my dearest--or else it would not be sent tomorrow; andthen I fear our head would ache, naughty head that it is
 My heartyearns to communicate to you; but if it had any other means at hand,it certainly would not choose to communicate by the scratchings of aniron pen, which I am now compelled to use
 This must and willinevitably be a dull letter
 Oh how different from yours, which Ireceived today
 You are absolutely inspired, my Dove; and it is not mypoor stupid self that inspires you; for how could I give what is notin me
 I wish I could write to you in the morning, before my toilsbegin; but that is impossible, unless I were to write before daylight
At eventide, my mind has quite lost its elasticity--my heart, even,is weary--and all that I seem capable of doing is to rest my head onits pillow and there lay down the burthen of life
 I do not mean toimply that I am unhappy or discontented; for this is not the case; mylife is only a burthen, in the same way that it is so to everytoilsome man, and mine is a healthy weariness, such as needs only anight's sleep to remove it
 But from henceforth forever, I shall beentitled to call the sons of toil my brethren, and shall know how tosympathise with them, seeing that I, likewise, have risen at the dawnand borne the fervor of the mid-day sun, nor turned my heavy footstepshomeward till eventide
 Years hence, perhaps, the experience that myheart is acquiring now will flow out in truth and wisdom
You ask me a good many questions, my Dove, and I will answer such ofthem as now occur to me; and the rest you may ask me again, when wemeet
 First as to your letters
 My beloved, you must write wheneveryou will--in all confidence that I can never be otherwise than joyfulto receive your letters
 Do not get into the habit of trying to findout, by any method save your own intuition, what is pleasing and whatis displeasing to me
 Whenever you need my counsel, or even myreproof, in any serious matter, you will not fail to receive it; but Iwish my Dove to be as free as a Bird of Paradise
 Now, as to thisaffair of the letters
 I have sometimes been a little annoyed at thesmiles of my brother measurers, who, notwithstanding the masculinefist of the direction, seem to know that such delicately sealed andfolded epistles can come only from a lady's small and tender hand
 Butthe annoyance is not on my own account; but because it seems as if theletters were prophaned by being smiled at--but this is, after all, amere fantasy, since the smilers know nothing about my Dove, nor that Ireally have a Dove; nor can they be certain that the letters come froma lady, nor, especially, can they have the remotest imagination whatheavenly letters they are
 The sum and substance is, that they aresmiling at nothing; and so it is no matter for their smiles
 I wouldnot give up one letter to avoid the "world's dread laugh,"--much lessto shun the good-natured raillery of three or four people who do notdream of giving pain
 Why has my Dove made me waste so much of myletter in this talk about nothing?My dearest, did you really think that I meant to express a doubtwhether we should enjoy each other's society so much, if we could betogether all the time
 No, no; for I always feel, that our momentaryand hurried interviews scarcely afford us time to taste the draught ofaffection that we drink from one another's hearts
 There is a preciousportion of our happiness wasted, because we are forced to enjoy it toogreedily
 But I thought, as you do, that there might be morecommunication of the intellect, as well as communion of heart, if wecould be oftener together
Your picture gallery of auxiliary verbs is an admirable fantasy
 Youare certainly the first mortal to whom it was given to behold a verb;though, it seems as if they ought to be visible, being creatures whoseoffice it is (if I remember my grammar aright) "to be, to do, and tosuffer
" Therein is comprehended all that we mortals are capable of
No; for, according to the definition, verbs do not feel, and cannotenjoy--they only exist, and act, and are miserable
 My Dove and I areno verbs--or if so, we are passive verbs, and therefore happy ones

     , Monday Eveg July 15th [1839]     My blessed Dove,Your letter was brought to me at East Cambridge thisafternoon:--otherwise I know not when I should have received it; for Iam so busy that I know not whether I shall have time to go to theCustom-House these two or three days
 I put it in my pocket, and didnot read it till just now, when I could be quiet in my ownchamber--for I always feel as if your letters were too sacred to beread in the midst of people--and (you will smile) I never read themwithout first washing my hands!And so my poor Dove is sick, and I cannot take her to my bosom
 I doreally feel as if I could cure her
 [Portion of letter missing] Oh, mydearest, do let our love be powerful enough to make you well
 I willhave faith in its efficacy--not that it will work an immediatemiracle--but it shall make you so well at heart that you cannotpossibly be ill in the body
 Partake of my health and strength, mybeloved
 Are they not your own, as well as mine? Yes--and your illnessis mine as well as yours; and with all the pain it gives me, the wholeworld should not buy my right to share in it
My dearest, I will not be much troubled, since you tell me (and yourword is always truth) that there is no need
 But, oh, be careful ofyourself--remembering how much earthly happiness depends on yourhealth
 Be tranquil--let me be your Peace, as you are mine
 Do notwrite to me, unless your heart be unquiet, and you think that you canquiet it by writing
God bless mine own Dove
 I have kissed those three last words
 Do youkiss them too
          Wednesday eveg
 July 17th [1839]     My Dearest,I did not know but you would like another little note--and I think Ifeel a strange impulse to write, now that the whole correspondencedevolves on me
 And I wrote my other note in such a hurry, that Iquite forgot to give you the praise which you so deserved, for bearingup so stoutly against the terrible misfortune of my non-appearance
Indeed, I do think my Dove is the strongest little dove that ever wascreated--never did any creature live, who could feel so acutely, andyet endure so well
This note must be a mere word, my beloved--and I wish I could make itthe very tenderest word that ever was spoken or written
 Imagine allthat I cannot write
God bless you, mine own Dove, and make you quite well against I takeyou to your home--which shall be on Saturday eveg, without fail
 Tillthen, dearest, spend your time in happy thoughts and happydreams--and let my image be among them
 Good bye, mine own Dove--Ihave kissed that holy word
     YOUR OWN, OWN, OWNEST
My Dove must not look for another note
          , July 24th, 1839--8 o'clock P

     Mine own,I am tired this evening, as usual, with my long day's toil; and myhead wants its pillow--and my soul yearns for the friend whom God hasgiven it--whose soul He has married to my soul
 Oh, my dearest, howthat thought thrills me! We are married! I felt it long ago; andsometimes, when I was seeking for some fondest word, it has been on mylips to call you--"Wife"! I hardly know what restrained me fromspeaking it--unless a dread (for that would have been an infinitepang to me) of feeling you shrink back, and thereby discovering thatthere was yet a deep place in your soul which did not know me
 Mineown Dove, need I fear it now? Are we not married? God knows we are
Often, I have silently given myself to you, and received you for myportion of human love and happiness, and have prayed Him to consecrateand bless the union
 Yes--we are married; and as God Himself hasjoined us, we may trust never to be separated, neither in Heaven noron Earth
 We will wait patiently and quietly, and He will lead usonward hand in hand (as He has done all along) like little children,and will guide us to our perfect happiness--and will teach us when ourunion is to be revealed to the world
 My beloved, why should we besilent to one another--why should our lips be silent--any longer onthis subject? The world might, as yet, misjudge us; and therefore wewill not speak to the world; but why should we not commune togetherabout all our hopes of earthly and external as well [as] our faith ofinward and eternal union? Farewell for tonight, my dearest--my soul'sbride!July 25th
 8 o'clock, P

 How does my Dove contrive to live andthrive, and keep her heart in cheerful trim, through a wholefortnight, with only one letter from me? It cannot be indifference; soit must be heroism--and how heroic! It does seem to me that my spiritwould droop and wither like a plant that lacked rain and dew, if itwere not for the frequent shower of your gentle and holy thoughts
 Butthen there is such a difference in our situations
 My Dove is athome--not, indeed, in her home of homes--but still in the midst oftrue affections; and she can live a spiritual life, spiritual andintellectual
 Now, my intellect, and my heart and soul, have no sharein my present mode of life--they find neither labor nor food in it;everything that I do here might be better done by a machine
 I am amachine, and am surrounded by hundreds of similar machines;--orrather, all of the business people are so many wheels of one greatmachine--and we have no more love or sympathy for one another than ifwe were made of wood, brass, or iron, like the wheels of other piecesof complicated machinery
 Perchance--but do not be frightened,dearest--the soul would wither and die within me, leaving nothing butthe busy machine, no germ for immortality, nothing that could taste ofheaven, if it were not for the consciousness of your deep, deep love,which is renewed to me with every letter
 Oh, my Dove, I have reallythought sometimes, that God gave you to me to be the salvation of mysoul
     (Rest of letter missing)     , July 30th, 8 (or thereabouts) P
M
 [1839]     Beloved,There was no letter from you to-day; and this circumstance, inconnection with your mention of a headache on Sunday, made meapprehensive that my Dove is not well
 Yet surely she would write, orcause to be written, intelligence of the fact (if fact it were) to thesharer of her well-being and ill-being
 Do, dearest, give me theassurance that you will never be ill without letting me know, and thenI shall always be at peace, and will not disquiet myself for thenon-reception of a letter; for really, I would not have you crowd yourother duties into too small a space, nor dispense with anything thatit is desirable to do, for the sake of writing to me
 If you were notto write for a whole year, I still should never doubt that you love meinfinitely; and I doubt not that, in vision, dream, or reverie, ourwedded souls would hold communion throughout all that time
Therefore I do not ask for letters while you are well, but leave allto your own heart and judgment; but if anything, bodily or mental,afflicts my Dove, her beloved must be told
And why was my dearest wounded by that silly sentence of mine about"indifference"? It was not well that she should do anything but smileat it
 I knew, just as certainly as your own heart knows, that myletters are very precious to you--had I been less certain of it, Inever could have trifled upon the subject
 Oh, my darling, let allyour sensibilities be healthy--never, never, be wounded by what oughtnot to wound
 Our tenderness should make us mutually susceptible ofhappiness from every act of each other, but of pain from none; ourmighty love should scorn all little annoyances, even from the objectof that love
 What misery (and what ridiculous misery too) would itbe, if, because we love one another better than all the universebesides, our only gain thereby were a more exquisite sensibility topain for the beloved hand and a more terrible power of inflicting it!Dearest, it never shall be so with us
 We will have such an infinityof mutual faith, that even real offenses (should they ever occur)shall not wound, because we know that something external from yourselfor myself must be guilty of the wrong, and never our essentialselves
 My beloved wife, there is no need of all this preachment now;but let us both meditate upon it, and talk to each other about it;--soshall there never come any cloud across our inward bliss--so shall oneof our hearts never wound the other, and itself fester with the sorethat it inflicts
 And I speak now, when my Dove is not wounded norsore, because it is easier than it might be hereafter, when somecareless and wayward act or word of mine may have rubbed too roughlyagainst her tenderest of hearts
 Dearest, I beseech you grant mefreedom to be careless and wayward--for I have had such freedom all mylife
 Oh, let me feel that I may even do you a little wrong withoutyour avenging it (oh how cruelly) by being wounded
     (Rest of letter missing)     Custom House, August 8th, 1839Your letter, my beloved wife, was duly received into your husband'sheart yesterday
 I found it impossible to keep it all day long, withunbroken seal, in my pocket; and so I opened and read it on board of asalt vessel, where I was at work, amid all sorts of bustle, and gabbleof Irishmen, and other incommodities
 Nevertheless its effect was veryblessed, even as if I had gazed upward from the deck of the vessel,and beheld my wife's sweet face looking down upon me from asun-brightened cloud
 Dearest, if your dove-wings will not carry youso far, I beseech you to alight upon such a cloud sometimes, and letit bear you to me
 True it is, that I never look heavenward withoutthinking of you, and I doubt whether it would much surprise me tocatch a glimpse of you among those upper regions
 Then would all thatis spiritual within me so yearn towards you, that I should leave myearthly incumbrances behind, and float upward and embrace you in theheavenly sunshine
 Yet methinks I shall be more content to spend alifetime of earthly and heavenly happiness intermixed
 So human am I,my beloved, that I would not give up the hope of loving and cherishingyou by a fireside of our own, not for any unimaginable bliss of higherspheres
 Your influence shall purify me and fit me for a betterworld--but it shall be by means of our happiness here below
Was such a rhapsody as the foregoing ever written in the Custom Housebefore? I have almost felt it a sin to write to my Dove here, becauseher image comes before me so vividly--and the place is not worthy ofit
 Nevertheless, I cast aside my scruples, because, having been awakeever since four o'clock this morning (now thirteen hours) and abroadsince sunrise, I shall feel more like holding intercourse in dreamsthan with my pen, when secluded in my room
 I am not quite hopeless,now, of meeting you in dreams
 Did you not know, beloved, that Idreamed of you, as it seemed to me, all night long, after that lastblissful meeting? It is true, when I looked back upon the dream, itimmediately became confused; but it had been vivid, and most happy,and left a sense of happiness in my heart
 Come again, sweet wife!Force your way through the mists and vapors that envelope myslumbers--illumine me with a radiance that shall not vanish when Iawake
 I throw my heart as wide open to you as I can
 Come and restwithin it, Dove
Oh, how happy you make me by calling me your husband--by subscribingyourself my wife
 I kiss that word when I meet it in your letters; andI repeat over and over to myself, "she is my wife--I am her husband
"Dearest, I could almost think that the institution of marriage wasordained, first of all, for you and me, and for you and me alone; itseems so fresh and new--so unlike anything that the people around usenjoy or are acquainted with
 Nobody ever had a wife but me--nobody ahusband, save my Dove
 Would that the husband were worthier of hiswife; but she loves him--and her wise and prophetic heart could neverdo so if he were utterly unworthy
My own Room
 August 9th--about 10 A
M
 It is so rare a thing foryour husband to find himself in his own room in the middle of theforenoon, that he cannot help advising his Dove of that remarkablefact
 By some misunderstanding, I was sent on a fruitless errand toEast Cambridge, and have stopped here, on my return to the CustomHouse, to rest and refresh myself--and what can so rest and refresh meas to hold intercourse with my darling wife? It must be but a word anda kiss, however--a written word and a shadowy kiss
 Good bye, dearest
I must go now to hold controversy, I suppose, with some plaguy littleFrenchman about a peck of coal more or less; but I will give mybeloved another word and kiss, when the day's toil is over
About 8 o'clock P

--I received your letter, your sweet, sweetletter, my sweetest wife, on reaching the Custom House
 Now as to thatswelled face of ours--it had begun to swell when we last met; but Idid not tell you, because I knew that you would associate the idea ofpain with it, whereas, it was attended with no pain at all
 Very gladam I, that my Dove did not see me when one side of my face was swollenas big as two, for the image of such a monstrous one-sidedness, ordouble-sidedness, might have haunted her memory through the wholefortnight
 Dearest, is it a weakness that your husband wishes to looktolerably comely always in your eyes?--and beautiful if he could!! MyDove is beautiful, and full of grace; she should not have an uglymate
 But to return to this "naughty swelling"--it began to subsideon Tuesday, and has now, I think, entirely disappeared, leaving myvisage in its former admirable proportion
 Nothing is now the matterwith me; save that my heart is as much swollen as my cheekwas--swollen with love, with pent-up love, which I would fain minglewith the heart-blood of mine own sweet wife
 Oh, dearest, how much Ihave to say to you!--how many fond thoughts
Dearest, I dare not give you permission to go out in the east winds
The west wind will come very often I am sure, if it were only for thesake of my Dove
 Have nothing to do with that hateful east wind
          , August 21st, 1839My dearest will be glad to know that her husband has not had to endurethe heavy sunshine this afternoon;--he came home at three o'clock orthereabout, and locking the door, betook himself to sleep--firstensuring himself sweet slumber and blissful dreams (if any dreamsshould come) by reperusing his sweet wife's letter
 His wife was withhim at the moment of falling asleep, and at the moment of awaking; butshe stole away from him during the interval
 Naughty wife!Nevertheless, he has slept and is refreshed--slept how long he doesnot know; but the sun has made a far progress downward, since heclosed his eyes
Oh, my wife, if it were possible that you should vanish from me, Ifeel and know that my soul would be solitary forever and ever
 Ialmost think that there would be no "forever" for me
 I could notencounter such a desolate Eternity, were you to leave me
 You are myfirst hope and my last
 If you fail me (but there is no such if) Imight toil onward through this life without much outward change, but Ishould sink down and die utterly upon the threshold of the drearyFuture
 Were you to find yourself deceived, you would betakeyourself at once to God and Heaven, in the certainty of there findinga thousand-fold recompense for all earthly disappointment; but withme, it seems as if hope and happiness would be torn up by the roots,and could never bloom again, neither in this soil nor the soil ofParadise
August 22d
 Five or six o'clock P

 I was interrupted by the supperbell, while writing the foregoing sentence; and much that I might haveadded has now passed out of my mind--or passed into its depths
 Mybeloved wife, let us make no question about our love, whether it betrue
 Were it otherwise, God would not have left your heart to wreckitself utterly--His angels keep watch over you--they would have givenyou early and continued warning of the approach of Evil in any shape
Two letters has my Dove blessed me with, since that of Monday--bothbeautiful--all three, indeed, most beautiful
 There is a great deal inall of them that should be especially answered; but how may this beeffected in one little sheet?--moreover, it is my pleasure to writein a more desultory fashion
Nevertheless, propound as many questions as you see fit, in yourletters, but, dearest, let it be without expectation of a setresponse
When I first looked at that shadow of the Passing Hour, I thought herexpression too sad; but the more I looked the sweeter and pleasanterit grew--and now I am inclined to think that few mortals are waited onby happier Hours than is my Dove, even in her pensive moods
 Mybeloved, you make a Heaven round about you, and dwell in itcontinually; and as it is your Heaven, so is it mine
 My heart has notbeen very heavy--not desperately heavy--any one time since I lovedyou; not even your illness and headaches, dearest wife, can make medesperately sad
 My stock of sunshine is so infinitely increased bypartaking of yours, that even when a cloud flits by, I incomparablyprefer its gloom to the sullen, leaden tinge that used to overspreadmy sky
 Were you to bring me, in outward appearance, nothing save aload of grief and pain, yet I do believe that happiness, in no stintedmeasure, would somehow or other be smuggled into the dismal burthen
But you come to me with no grief--no pain--you come with flowers ofParadise; some in bloom, many in the bud, and all of them immortal

 Dearest wife, when I think how soonthis letter will greet you, it makes my heart yearn towards you somuch the more
 How much of life we waste! Oh, beloved, if we had but acottage somewhere beyond the sway of the east wind, yet within thelimits of New England, where we could be always together, and have aplace to be in--what could we desire more? Nothing--save dailybread, (or rather bread and milk, for I think I should adopt yourdiet) and clean white apparel every day for mine unspotted Dove
 Thenhow happy I would be--and how good! I could not be other than good andhappy, when your kiss would sanctify me at all my outgoings andincomings
 And you should draw, and paint, and sculpture, and makemusic, and poetry too, and your husband would admire and criticise;and I, being pervaded with your spirit, would write beautifully andmake myself famous for your sake, because perhaps you would like tohave the world acknowledge me--but if the whole world glorified mewith one voice, it would be a meed of little value in comparison withmy wife's smile and kiss
 For I shall always read my manuscripts toyou, in the summer afternoons or winter evenings; and if they pleaseyou I shall expect a smile and a kiss as my reward--and if they do notplease, I must have a smile and kiss to comfort me
Good bye--sweet, sweet, dear, dear, sweetest, dearest wife
 I receivedthe kiss you sent me and have treasured it up in my heart
 Take onefrom your own husband

     , August 25th, 1839     Dearest Wife,I did not write you yesterday, for several reasons--partly becauseI was interrupted by company; and also I had a difficult letterto project and execute in behalf of an office-seeker; and inthe afternoon I fell asleep amid thoughts of my own Dove; andwhen I awoke, I took up Miss Martineau's Deerbrook, and becameinterested in it--because, being myself a lover, nothing that treatsearnestly of love can be indifferent to me
 Some truth in the bookI recognised--but there seems to be too much of dismal fantasy
Thus, one way or another, the Sabbath passed away without my pouringout my heart to my sweet wife on paper; but I thought of you, dearest,all day long
 Your letter came this forenoon, and I opened it on boardof a salt-ship, and snatched portions of it in the intervals ofkeeping tally
 Every letter of yours is as fresh and new as if you hadnever written a preceding one--each is like a strain of music unheardbefore, yet all are in sweet accordance--all of them introduce medeeper and deeper into your being, yet there is no sense of surpriseat what I see, and feel, and know, therein
 I am familiar with yourinner heart, as with my home; but yet there is a sense ofrevelation--or perhaps of recovered intimacy with a dearest friendlong hidden from me
 Were you not my wife in some past eternity?Dearest, perhaps these speculations are not wise
 We will not castdreamy glances too far behind us or before us, but live our presentlife in simplicity; for methinks that is the way to realise it mostintensely
 Good night, most beloved
 Your husband is presently goingto bed; for the bell has just rung (those bells are alwaysinterrupting us, whether for dinner, or supper, or bed-time) and herose early this morning, and must be abroad at sunrise tomorrow
 Goodnight, my wife
 Receive your husband's kiss upon your eyelids
August 27th
 ½ past 7 o'clock
 Very dearest, your husband has beenstationed all day at the end of Long Wharf, and I rather think that hehad the most eligible situation of anybody in 
 I was aware thatit must be intensely hot in the middle of the city; but there was onlya very short space of uncomfortable heat in my region, half-waytowards the center of the harbour; and almost all the time there was apure and delightful breeze, fluttering and palpitating, sometimesshyly kissing my brow, then dying away, and then rushing upon me inlivelier sport, so that I was fain to settle my straw hat tighter uponmy head
 Late in the afternoon, there was a sunny shower, which camedown so like a benediction, that it seemed ungrateful to take shelterin the cabin, or to put up an umbrella
 Then there was a rainbow, or alarge segment of one, so exceedingly brilliant, and of such longendurance, that I almost fancied it was stained into the sky, andwould continue there permanently
 And there were clouds floating allabout, great clouds and small, of all glorious and lovely hues (savethat imperial crimson, which was never revealed save to our unitedgaze) so glorious, indeed, and so lovely, that I had a fantasy ofHeaven's being broken into fleecy fragments, and dispersedthroughout space, with its blessed inhabitants yet dwelling blissfullyupon those scattered islands
 Oh, how I do wish that my sweet wife andI could dwell upon a cloud, and follow the sunset round about theearth! Perhaps she might; but my nature is too earthy to permit me todwell there with her--and I know well that she would not leave mehere
 Dearest, how I longed for you to be with me, both in the showerand the sunshine
 I did but half see what was to be seen, nor but halffeel the emotions which the scene ought to have produced
 Had you beenthere, I do think that we should have remembered this among our mostwondrously beautiful sunsets
 And the sea was very beautiful too
Would it not be a pleasant life to--but I will not sketch out any morefantasies tonight
Beloved, have not I been gone a great while? Truly it seems to me verylong; and it [is] strange what an increase of apparent length isalways added by two or three days of the second week
 Do not you yearnto see me? I know you do, dearest
 How do I know it? How should I,save by my own heart?Dearest wife, I am tired now, and have scribbled this letter in suchslovenly fashion that I fear you will hardly be able to readit--nevertheless, I have been happy in writing it
 But now, though itis so early yet, I shall throw aside my pen, especially as the paperis so nearly covered
My sweet Dove,     Good night

Belovedest little wife--sweetest Sophie Hawthorne--what a deliciouswalk that was, last Thursday! It seems to me, now, as it I couldreally remember every footstep of it
 It is almost as distinct as therecollection of those walks, in which my earthly form did really treadbeside your own, and my arm upheld you; and, indeed, it has the samecharacter as those heavenly ramblings;--for did we tread on earth everthen? Oh no--our souls went far away among the sunset clouds, andwherever there was ethereal beauty, there were we, our true selves;and it was there we grew into each other, and became a married pair
Dearest, I love to date our marriage as far back as possible, and Ifeel sure that the tie had been formed, and our union had becomeindissoluble, even before we sat down together on the steps of the"house of spirits
" How beautiful and blessed those hours appear tome! True; we are far more conscious of our relation, and thereforeinfinitely happier, now, than we were then; but still thoseremembrances are among the most precious treasures of my soul
 It isnot past happiness; it makes a portion of our present bliss
 And thus,doubtless, even amid the joys of Heaven, we shall love to look back toour earthly bliss, and treasure it forever in the sum of an infinitelyaccumulating happiness
 Perhaps not a single pressure of the hand, nota glance, not a sweet and tender tone, but will be repeated sometimeor other in our memory
Oh, dearest, blessedest Dove, I never felt sure of going to Heaven,till I knew that you loved me; but now I am conscious of God's love inyour own
 And now, good bye for a little while, mine own wife
 Ithought it was just on the verge of supper-time when I began towrite--and there is the bell now
 I was beginning to fear that it hadrung unheard while I was communing with my Dove
 Should we be the moreethereal, if we did not eat? I have a most human and earthlyappetite
Mine own wife, since supper I have been reading over again (for thethird time--the two first being aboard my saltship--the MarciaCleaves) your letter of yesterday--and a dearest letter it is--andmeeting with Sophie Hawthorne twice, I took the liberty to kiss hervery fervently
 Will she forgive me? Do know yourself by that name,dearest, and think of yourself as Sophie Hawthorne? It thrills myheart to write it, and still more, I think, to read it in the fairyletters of your own hand
 Oh, you are my wife, my dearest, truest,tenderest, most beloved wife
 I would not be disjoined from you for amoment, for all the world
 And how strong, while I write, is theconsciousness that I am truly your husband!My little Dove
 I have observed that butterflies--very broad-wingedand magnificent butterflies--frequently come on board of the salt shipwhen I am at work
 What have these bright strangers to do on LongWharf, where there are no flowers or any green thing--nothing butbrick stores, stone piles, black ships, and the bustle of toilsomemen, who neither look up to the blue sky, nor take note of thesewandering gems of air
 I cannot account for them, unless, dearest,they are the lovely fantasies of your mind, which you send thitherin search of me
 There is the supper-bell
 Good-bye, darling

Belovedest, your two precious letters have arrived--the firstyesterday forenoon, the second today
 In regard to the first, therewas a little circumstance that affected me so pleasantly, that Icannot help telling my sweetest wife of it
 I had read it over threetimes, I believe, and was reading it again, towards evening in myroom; when I discovered, in a remote region of the sheet, two or threelines which I had not before seen, and which Sophie Hawthorne hadsigned with her own name
 It is the strangest thing in the world thatI had not read them before--but certainly it was a happy accident;for, finding them so unexpectedly, when I supposed that I already hadthe whole letter by heart, it seemed as if there had been a suddenrevelation of my Dove--as if she had stolen into my room (as, in herlast epistle, she dreams of doing) and made me sensible of herpresence at that very moment
 Dearest, since writing the above, Ihave been interrupted by some official business; for I am at presentfilling the place of Colonel Hall as head of the measurers'department--which may account for my writing to you from the CustomHouse
 It is the most ungenial place in the whole world to write alove-letter in:--not but what my heart is full of love, here aselsewhere: but it closes up, and will not give forth its treasure now
I do wish mine own Dove had been with me, on my last passage to
 We should assuredly have thought that a miracle had beenwrought in our favor--that Providence had put angelic sentinels roundabout us, to ensure us the quiet enjoyment of our affection--for, asfar as Lynn, I was actually the sole occupant of the car in which Ihad seated myself
 What a blissful solitude would that have been, hadmy whole self been there! Then would we have flown through space liketwo disembodied spirits--two or one
 Are we singular or plural,dearest? Has not each of us a right to use the first person singular,when speaking in behalf of our united being? Does not "I," whetherspoken by Sophie Hawthorne's lips or mine, express the one spirit ofmyself and that darlingest Sophie Hawthorne? But what a wilful littleperson she is! Does she still refuse my Dove's proffer to kiss hercheek? Well--I shall contrive some suitable punishment: and if my Dovecannot kiss her, I must undertake the task in person
 What a painfulduty it will be!October 11th--½ past 4 P
M
 Did my Dove fly in with me in my chamberwhen I entered just now? If so, let her make herself manifest to methis very moment, for my heart needs her presence
--You are not heredearest
 I sit writing in the middle of the chamber, opposite thelooking-glass; and as soon as I finish this sentence, I shall looktherein--and really I have something like a shadowy notion, that Ishall behold mine own white Dove peeping over my shoulder
 One momentmore--I defer the experiment as long as possible, because there is apleasure in the slight tremor of the heart that this fantasy hasawakened
 Dearest, if you can make me sensible of your presence, do itnow!--Oh, naughty, naughty Dove! I have looked, and saw nothing but myown dark face and beetle-brow
 How could you disappoint me so? Or isit merely the defect in my own eyes, which cannot behold thespiritual? My inward eye can behold you, though but dimly
 Perhaps,beloved wife, you did not come when I called, because you mistook thelocality whence the call proceeded
 You are to know, then, that Ihave removed from my old apartment, which was wanted as a parlor byMr
 and Mrs
 Devens, and am now established in a back chamber--apleasant enough and comfortable little room
 The windows have a betterprospect than those of my former chamber, for I can see the summit ofthe hill on which Gardner Greene's estate was situated; it is thehighest point of the city, and the boys at play on it are paintedstrongly against the sky
 No roof ascends as high as this--nothing butthe steeple of the Park-street church, which points upward behind it
It is singular that such a hill should have been suffered to remain solong, in the very heart of the city; it affects me somewhat as if aportion of the original forest were still growing here
 But they arefast digging it away now; and if they continue their labors, I shallsoon be able to see the Park-street steeple as far downward as thedial
 Moreover, in another direction, I can see the top of the dome ofthe State-House; and if my Dove were to take wing and alight there(the easiest thing in the world for a dove to do) she might lookdirectly into my window, and see me writing this letter
 I glancethither as I write, but can see no Dove there

     Ownest Dove;Did you get home safe and sound, and with a quiet and happy heart?Providence acted lovingly toward us on Tuesday evening, allowing us tomeet in the wide desert of this world, and mingle our spirits
 Itwould have seemed all a vision then, now we have the symbol of itsreality
 You looked like a vision, beautifullest wife, with the widthof the room between us--so spiritual that my human heart wanted to beassured that you had an earthly vesture on
 What beautiful white dovesthose were, on the border of the vase; are they of mine own Dove'skindred? Do you remember a story of a cat who was changed into alovely lady?--and on her bridal night, a mouse happened to run acrossthe floor; and forthwith the cat-wife leaped out of bed to catch it
What if mine own Dove, in some woeful hour for her poor husband,should remember her dove-instincts, and spread her wings upon thewestern breeze, and return to him no more! Then would he stretch outhis arms, poor wingless biped, not having the wherewithal to fly, andsay aloud--"Come back, naughty Dove!--whither are you going?--comeback, and fold your wings upon my heart again, or it will freeze!" Andthe Dove would flutter her wings, and pause a moment in the air,meditating whether or no she should come back: for in truth, as herconscience would tell her, this poor mortal had given her all he hadto give--a resting-place on his bosom--a home in his deepest heart
But then she would say to herself--"my home is in the gladsomeair--and if I need a resting-place, I can find one on any of thesunset-clouds
 He is unreasonable to call me back; but if he canfollow me, he may!" Then would the poor deserted husband do his bestto fly in pursuit of the faithless Dove; and for that purpose wouldascend to the topmast of a salt-ship, and leap desperately into theair, and fall down head-foremost upon the deck, and break his neck
And there should be engraven on his tombstone--"Mate not thyself witha Dove, unless thou hast wings to fly
"Now will my Dove scold at me for this foolish flight of fancy;--butthe fact is, my goose quill flew away with me
 I do think that Ihave gotten a bunch of quills from the silliest flock of geese onearth
 But the rest of the letter shall be very sensible
 I saw Mr
Howes in the reading-room of [the] Athenaeum, between one and twoo'clock to-day; for I happened to have had leisure for an earlydinner, and so was spending a half-hour turning over the periodicals
He spoke of the long time since your husband had been at his house;and so I promised, on behalf of that respectable personage, that hewould spend an evening there on his next visit to Salem
 But if I hadsuch a sweetest wife as your husband has, I doubt whether I could find[it] in my heart to keep the engagement
 Now, good night, truest Dovein the world
 You will never fly away from me; and it is only theinfinite impossibility of it that enables me to sport with the idea
Dearest, there was an illegible word in your yesterday's note
 I havepored over it, but cannot make it out
 Your words are too precious tobe thus hidden under their own vesture
 Good night, wife!October 4th
--5 or thereabout P
M
 Mine own Dove, I dreamed thequeerest dreams last night, about being deserted, and all suchnonsense--so you see how I was punished for that naughty nonsense ofthe Faithless Dove
 It seems to me that my dreams are generally aboutfantasies, and very seldom about what I really think and feel
 You didnot appear visibly in my last night's dreams: but they were made up ofdesolation; and it was good to awake, and know that my spirit wasforever and irrevocably linked with the soul of my truest andtenderest Dove
 You have warmed my heart, mine own wife: and neveragain can I know what it is to be cold and desolate, save in dreams
You love me dearly--don't you?And so my Dove has been in great peril since we parted
 No--I do notbelieve she was; it was only a shadow of peril, not a reality
 Myspirit cannot anticipate any harm to you, and I trust you to God withsecurest faith
 I know not whether I could endure actually to see youin danger: but when I hear of any risk--as, for instance, when yoursteed seemed to be on the point of dashing you to pieces (but I doquake a little at that thought) against a tree--my mind does not seizeupon it as if it had any substance
 Believe me, dearest, the treewould have stood aside to let you pass, had there been no other meansof salvation
 Nevertheless, do not drive your steed against treeswilfully
 Mercy on us, what a peril that was of the fat woman, whenshe "smashed herself down" beside my Dove! Poor Dove! Did you not feelas if an avalanche had all but buried you
 I can see my Dove at thismoment, my slender, little delicatest white Dove, squeezed almost outof Christendom by that great mass of female flesh--that ton ofwoman--that beef-eater and beer-guzzler, whose immense cloak, thoughbroad as a ship's mainsail, could not be made to meet in front--thatpicture of an ale-wife--that triple, quadruple, dozen-fold old lady
Will not my Dove confess that there is a little nonsense in thisepistle? But be not wroth with me, darling wife;--my heart sports withyou because it loves you
If you happen to see Sophie Hawthorne, kiss her cheek for my sake
 Ilove her full as well as I do mine own wife
 Will that satisfy her, doyou think? If not, she is a very unreasonable little person
It is my chiefest pleasure to write to you, dearest
     YOUR OWNEST HUSBAND

     Dear little Dove,Here sits your husband, comfortably established for the evening in hisown domicile, with a cheerful coal fire making the room a little toowarm
 I think I like to be a very little too warm
 And now if my Dovewere here, she and that naughty Sophie Hawthorne, how happy we allthree--two--one--(how many are there of us?)--how happy might we be!Dearest, it will be a yet untasted bliss, when, for the first time, Ihave you in a domicile of my own, whether it be in a hut or a palace,a splendid suit of rooms or an attic chamber
 Then I shall feel as ifI had brought my wife home at last
 Shall Sophie Hawthorne be theretoo? Yes, mine own Dove, whether you like it or no
 You would wonder,were I to tell you how absolutely necessary she has contrived torender herself to your husband
 His heart stirs at her very name--evenat the thought of her unspoken name
 She is his sunshine--she is ahappy smile on the visage of his Destiny, causing that stern personageto look as benign as Heaven itself
 And were Sophie Hawthorne a tearinstead of a smile, still your foolish husband would hold out hisheart to receive that tear within it, and doubtless would think itmore precious than all the smiles and sunshine in the world
 ButSophie Hawthorne has bewitched him--for there is great reason tosuspect that she deals in magic
 Sometimes, while your husbandconceives himself to be holding his Dove in his arms, lo and behold!there is the arch face of Sophie Hawthorne peeping up at him
 Andagain, in the very midst of Sophie Hawthorne's airs, while he ismeditating what sort of chastisement would suit her misdemeanors, allof a sudden he becomes conscious of his Dove, with her wings foldedupon his heart to keep it warm
 Methinks a woman, or angel (yet let itbe a woman, because I deem a true woman holier than an angel)--methinks a woman, then, who should combine the characteristics ofSophie Hawthorne and my Dove would be the very perfection of her race
The heart would find all it yearns for, in such a woman, and so wouldthe mind and the fancy;--when her husband was lightsome of spirit,her merry fantasies would dance hand in hand with his; and when hewas overburthened with cares he would rest them all upon her bosom
Dearest, your husband was called on by Mr
 Hillard yesterday, who saidthat he intended soon to take a house in , and, in that case,would like to take your respectable spouse to lodge and breakfast
What thinks my Dove of this? Your husband is quite delighted, becausehe thinks matters may be managed so that once in a while he may meethis own wife within his own premises
 Might it not be so? Or would hiswife--most preposterous idea!--deem it a sin against decorum to pay avisit to her husband? Oh, no, belovedest
 Your unreserve, yourout-gushing frankness, is one of the loveliest results of your purity,and innocence, and holiness
 And now good night, wife worshipful andbeloved
 Amid many musings, nine o'clock has surprised me at thisstage of my epistle
October 24th
--½ past 6 P

 Dearest Dove, your letter came to-day;and I do think it the sweetest of all letters--but you must nottherefore suppose that you have excelled yourself; for I think thesame of each successive one
 My dearest, what a delightful scene wasthat between Sophie Hawthorne and my Dove, when the former rebelledso stoutly against Destiny, and the latter, with such meekmournfulness, submitted
 Which do I love the best, I wonder--my Dove,or my little Wild-Flower? I love each best, and both equally; and myheart would inevitably wither and dry up, and perish utterly, ifeither of them were torn away from it
 Yet, truly I have reason toapprehend more trouble with Sophie Hawthorne than with my Dove
          Custom House, Novr
 14th [1839]     My dearest Wife,May God sustain you under this affliction
 I have long dreaded it foryour sake
 Oh, let your heart be full of love for me now, and realisehow entirely my happiness depends on your well-being
 You are not yourown, dearest--you must not give way to grief
 Were it possible, Iwould come to see you now
I will write you again on Saturday
     YOUR OWN HUSBAND
My dearest, this note seems cold and lifeless to me, as if there wereno tenderness nor comfort in it
 Think for yourself all that I cannotspeak
          , Novr
 15th--very late [1839]Dearest and best wife, I meant to have written you a long letter thisevening; but an indispensable and unexpected engagement with Gen
M'Neil has prevented me
 Belovedest, your yesterday's letter wasreceived; and gave me infinite comfort
 Yet, Oh, be prepared for theworst--if this may be called worst, which is in truth best forall--and more than all for George
 I cannot help trembling for you,dearest
 God bless you and keep you
I will write a full letter in a day or two
 Meantime, as your husbandis to rise with peep of day tomorrow, he must betake him to hismattress

 or thereabout
I received no letter from my sweetest wife yesterday; and my heart isnot quite at ease about her
 Dearest, I pray to God for you--and Ipray to yourself, too; for methinks there is within you a divine andmiraculous power to counteract all sorts of harm
 Oh be strong for thesake of your husband
 Let all your love for me be so much added to thestrength of your heart
 Remember that your anguish must likewise bemine
 Not that I would have it otherwise, mine own wife--your sorrowsshall be just as precious a possession to me as your joys
Dearest, if you could steal in upon your husband now, you would see acomfortable sight
 I wish you would make a sketch of me, here in ourown parlour; and it might be done without trusting entirely toimagination, as you have seen the room and the furniture--and (thoughthat would be the least important item of the picture) you have seenmyself
 I am writing now at my new bureau, which stands between thewindows; there are two lamps before me, which show the polishedshadings of the mahogany panels to great advantage
 A coal fire isburning in the grate--not a very fervid one, but flickering upfitfully, once in a while, so as to remind me that I am by my ownfireside
 I am sitting in the cane-bottomed rocking-chair (wherein myDove once sate, but which did not meet her approbation); and anotherhair-cloth arm-chair stands in front of the fire
 Would that I couldlook round with the assurance of seeing mine own white Dove in it! Notthat I want to see her apparition--nor to have her brought here bymiracle, but I want that full assurance of peace and joy, which Ishould have if my belovedest wife were near me in our own parlor
Sophie Hawthorne, what a beautiful carpet did you choose for me! Iadmire it so much that I can hardly bear to tread upon it
 It is fitonly to be knelt upon; and I do kneel on it sometimes
 As you saw itonly in narrow strips, I doubt whether even you can imagine what aneffect is produced by the tout ensemble, spreading its fantasticfoliage, or whatever it is, all over the floor
 Many times today haveI found myself gazing at it; and I am almost tempted to call in peoplefrom the street to help me admire it worthily
 But perhaps theywould not quite sympathize with my raptures
 I am doubtless somewhatmore alive to the merits of this carpet, because it was your choice,and is our mutual property
 My Dove, there is an excellent place for abust over the bookcase which surmounts my bureau; some time or other,I shall behold a creation of your own upon it
 At present, I have nowork of art to adorn our parlour with, except an allumette-holder, onthe mantel-piece ornamented with drawings from Flaxman
 It was givenme by Elizabeth; and, considerably to my vexation, one of the glasseshas been broken, during the recent removal of my household gods
My wife, I like sleeping on a mattress better than on a feather-bed
It is a pity, however, that a mattress looks so lean and lank;--itcertainly does not suggest such ideas of comfort and downy repose as awell-filled feather-bed does; but my sleep, I think, is of betterquality, though, indeed, there was nothing to complain of on thatscore, even while I reposed on feathers
 You need not be afraid of mysmothering in the little bed-room; for I always leave the door open,so that I have the benefit of the immense volume of air in thespacious parlor
Mrs
 Hillard takes excellent care of me, and feeds [me] with eggsand baked apples and other delectable dainties; and altogether I am ashappily situated as a man can be, whose heart is wedded, whileexternally he is still a bachelor
My wife, would you rather that I should come home next Saturday andstay till Monday, or that I should come to Thanksgiving and stay therest of the week? Both I cannot do; but I will try to do the latter,if you wish it; and I think I shall finish the salt-ship which I amnow engaged upon, about Thanksgiving time--unless foul weatherintervene to retard our progress
 How delightfully long the eveningsare now! I do not get intolerably tired any longer; and my thoughtssometimes wander back to literature and I have momentary impulses towrite stories
 But this will not be, at present
 The utmost that I canhope to do, will be to portray some of the characteristics of the lifewhich I am now living, and of the people with whom I am brought intocontact, for future use
 I doubt whether I shall write any more forthe public, till I can have a daily or nightly opportunity ofsubmitting my productions to the criticism of Sophie Hawthorne
 I havea high opinion of that young lady's critical acumen, but a great dreadof her severity--which, however, the Dove will not fail to temper withher sweetness
Dearest, there is nothing at all in this letter; and perhaps it maycome to you at a time when your heart needs the strongest, andtenderest, and most comfortable words that mine can speak to it
 Yetwhat could I say, but to assure you that I love you, and partakewhatever of good or evil God sends you--or rather, partake whatevergood God sends you, whether it come in festal garments or mourningones; for still it is good, whether arrayed in sable, orflower-crowned
 God bless you, belovedest,     YOUR OWNEST HUSBAND

, [1839]     Belovedest Wife,My heart bids me to send you a greeting; and therefore I do it,although I do not feel as if I had many thoughts and words at commandtonight, but only feelings and sympathies, which must find their wayto you as well as they can
 Dearest, I cannot bear to think of yousitting all day long in that chamber, and not a soul to commune withyou
 But I endeavor, and will still endeavor, to send my soul thither,from out of the toil and tedium of my daily life;--so think, beloved,whenever solitude and sad thoughts become intolerable, that, just atthat moment I am near you, and trying to comfort you and make yousensible of my presence
Beloved, it occurs to me, that my earnest entreaties to you to be calmand strong may produce an effect not altogether good
 The behests ofNature may perhaps differ from mine, and be wiser
 If she bids youshed tears, methinks it will be best to let them flow, and then yourgrief will melt quietly forth, instead of being pent up till it breaksout in a torrent
 But I cannot speak my counsel to you, dearest, sodecidedly as if I were with you; for then my heart would know all thestate of yours, and what it needed
 But love me infinitely, my wife,and rest your heart with all its heaviness on mine
 I know not whatelse to say;--but even that is saying something--is it not, dearest?I rather think, beloved, that I shall come home on Saturday night, andtake my chance of being able to come again on Thanksgiving-day
 Butthen I shall not be able to remain the rest of the week
 That you wantme I know; and, dearest, my head and heart are weary with absence fromyou; so that it will be best to snatch the first chance that offers
Soon, mine own wife, I shall be able to spend much more time with you

, [1839]Dearest, you know not how your blessed letter strengthens my heart onyour account; for I know by it that God and the angels are supportingyou
 And, mine own wife, though I thought that I reverenced youinfinitely before, yet never was so much of that feeling mingled withmy love, as now
 You are yourself one of the angels who minister toyour departing brother--the more an angel, because you triumph overearthly weakness to perform those offices of affection
 I feel, now,with what confidence I can rest upon you in all my sorrows andtroubles--as confident of your strength as of your love
 Dearest,there is nothing in me worthy of you
 My heart is weak in comparisonwith yours
 Its strength, it is true, has never been tried; for I havenever been called to minister at the dying bed of a dear friend; but Ihave often thought, that, in such a scene, I should need support fromthe dying, instead of being able to give it
 I bless God that He hasmade Death so beautiful as he appears in the scene which youdescribe--that He has caused the light from the other side to shineover and across the chasm of the grave
My wife, my spirit has never yearned for communion with you so much asit does now
 I long to hold you on my bosom--to hold you theresilently--for I have no words to write my sympathy, and should havenone to speak them
 Sometimes, even after all I have now learned ofyour divine fortitude, I feel as if I shall dread to meet you, lest Ishould find you quite worn down by this great trial
 But, dearest, Iwill make up my mind to see you pale, and thinner than you were
 Onlydo not be sick--do not give me too much to bear

 Mine own Dove, your fourth letter cametoday, and all the rest were duly received, and performed theirheaven-appointed mission to my soul
 The last has left a very cheeringinfluence on my spirit
 Dearest, I love that naughty Sophie Hawthornewith an unspeakable affection, and bless God for her every minute; forwhat my Dove could do without her, passes my comprehension
 And, mineown wife, I have not been born in vain, but to an end worth livingfor, since you are able to rest your heart on me, and are therebysustained in this sorrow, and enabled to be a help and comfort to yourmother, and a ministering angel to George
 Give my love to George
 Iregret that we have known each other so little in life; but there willbe time enough hereafter--in that pleasant region "on the other side
"Beloved, I shall come on Saturday, but probably not till the fiveo'clock train, unless it should storm; so you must not expect me tillseven or thereabouts
 I never did yearn for you so much as now
 Thereis a feeling in me as if a great while had passed since we met
 Is itso with you?The days are cold now, the air eager and nipping--yet it suits myhealth amazingly
 I feel as if I could run a hundred miles at astretch, and jump over all the houses that happen to be in my way
Belovedest, I must bring this letter to a close now, for severalreasons--partly that I may carry it to the Post-Office before itcloses; for I hate to make your father pay the postage of my wife'sletters
 Also, I have another short letter of business to write;--and,moreover, I must go forth into the wide world to seek my supper
 Thislife of mine is the perfection of a bachelor-life--so perfectlyuntrammelled as it is
 Do you not fear, my wife, to trust me to livein such a way any longer?Belovedest, still keep up your heart for your husband's sake
 I prayto God for quiet sleeps for my Dove, and cheerful awakings--yes,cheerful; for Death moves with a sweet aspect into your household; andyour brother passes away with him as with a friend
 And now farewell,dearest of wives
 You are the hope and joy of your husband's heart
Never, never forget how very precious you are to him
 God bless you,dearest
     YOUR OWNEST HUSBAND

     Belovedest Wife,This very day I have held you in my arms; and yet, now that I findmyself again in my solitary room, it seems as if a long while hadalready passed--long enough, as I trust my Dove will think, to excusemy troubling her with an epistle
 I came off in the two o'clock cars,through such a pouring rain, that doubtless Sophie Hawthorne set itdown for certain that I should pass the day and night in Salem
 Andperhaps she and the Dove are now watching, with beating heart, to hearyour husband lift the door-latch
 Alas, that they must bedisappointed! Dearest, I feel that I ought to be with you now; for itgrieves me to imagine you all alone in that chamber, where you "sitand wait"--as you said to me this morning
 This, I trust, is thelast of your sorrow, mine own wife; in which you will not have all theaid that your husband's bosom, and the profoundest sympathy thatexists within it, can impart
I found your letter in the Measurer's Desk; and though I knewperfectly well that it was there, and had thought of it repeatedly,yet it struck me with a sense of unexpectedness when I saw it
 I putit in my breast-pocket, and did not open it till I found myselfcomfortably settled for the evening; for I took my supper of oysterson my way to my room, and have nothing to do with the busy world tillsunrise tomorrow
 Oh, mine own beloved, it seems to me the only thingworth living for that I have ever done, or been instrumental in, thatGod has made me the means of saving you from the heaviest anguish ofyour brother's loss
 Ever, ever, dearest wife, keep my image, orrather my reality, between yourself and pain of every kind
 Let meclothe you in my love as in an armour of proof--let me wrap my spiritround about your own, so that no earthly calamity may come inimmediate contact with it, but be felt, if at all, through a softeningmedium
 And it is a blessed privilege, and even a happy one, to givesuch sympathy as my Dove requires--happy to give--and, dearest, is itnot also happiness to receive it? Our happiness consists in our senseof the union of our hearts--and has not that union been far moredeeply felt within us now, than if all our ties were those of joy andgladness? Thus may every sorrow leave us happier than it found us, bycausing our hearts to embrace more closely in the mutual effort tosustain it
Dearest, I pray God that your strength may not fail you at the closeof this scene
 My heart is not quite at rest about you
 It seems tome, on looking back, that there was a vague inquietude within me allthrough this last visit; and this it was, perhaps, that made me seemmore sportive than usual
Did I tell my carefullest little wife that I had bought me a fur cap,wherewith my ears may bid defiance to the wintry blast--a poor image,by the way, to talk of ears bidding defiance
 The nose might do it,because it is capable of emitting sounds like a trumpet--indeed,Sophie Hawthorne's nose bids defiance without any sound
 But whatnonsense this is
 Also (I have now been a married man long enough tofeel these details perfectly natural, in writing to my wife) yourhusband, having a particular dislike to flannel, is resolved, everycold morning, to put on two shirts, and has already done so on oneoccasion, wonderfully to his comfort
 Perhaps--but this I leave toSophie Hawthorne's judgment--it might be well to add a daily shirtto my apparel as the winter advances, and to take them off again, oneby one, with the approach of spring
 Dear me, what a puffed-out heapof cotton-bagging would your husband be, by the middle of January! HisDove would strive in vain to fold her wings around him
My beloved, this is Thanksgiving week
 Do you remember how we wereemployed, or what our state of feeling was, at this time last year? Ihave forgotten how far we had advanced into each other's hearts--orrather, how conscious we had become that we were mutually within oneanother--but I am sure we were already dearest friends
 But now oureyes are opened
 Now we know that we have found all in each other--allthat life has to give--and a foretaste of eternity
 At every formerThanksgiving-day I have been so ungrateful to Heaven as to feel thatsomething was wanting, and that my life so far had been abortive; andtherefore, I fear, there has often been repining instead ofthankfulness in my heart
 Now I can thank God that he has given me myDove, and all the world in her
 I wish, dearest, that we could eat ourThanksgiving dinner together; and were it nothing but your bowl ofbread and milk, we would both of us be therewith content
 But I mustsit at our mother's table
 One of these days, sweetest wife, we willinvite her to our own
Will my Dove expect a letter from me so soon? I have written thisevening, because I expect to be engaged tomorrow--moreover, my heartbade me write
 God bless and keep you, dearest

     Blessedest wife,Does our head ache this evening?--and has it ached all or any of thetime to-day? I wish I knew, dearest, for it seems almost too great ablessing to expect, that my Dove should come quite safe through thetrial which she has encountered
 Do, mine own wife, resume all yourusual occupations as soon as possible--your sculpture, your painting,your music (what a company of sister-arts is combined in the littleperson of my Dove!)--and above all, your riding and walking
 Writeoften to your husband, and let your letters gush from a cheerfulheart; so shall they refresh and gladden me, like draughts from asparkling fountain, which leaps from some spot of earth where no gravehas ever been dug
 Dearest, for some little time to come, I pray younot to muse too much upon your brother, even though such musingsshould be untinged with gloom, and should appear to make you happier
In the eternity where he now dwells, it has doubtless become of noimportance to himself whether he died yesterday, or a thousand yearsago; he is already at home in the celestial city--more at home thanever he was in his mother's house
 Then, my beloved, let us leave himthere for the present; and if the shadows and images of this fleetingtime should interpose between us and him, let us not seek to drivethem away, for they are sent of God
 By and bye, it will be good andprofitable to commune with your brother's spirit; but so soon afterhis release from mortal infirmity, it seems even ungenerous towardshimself, to call him back by yearnings of the heart and too vividpicturings of what he was
Little Dove, why did you shed tears the other day, when you supposedthat your husband thought you to blame for regretting the irrevocablepast? Dearest, I never think you to blame; for you positively have nofaults
 Not that you always act wisely, or judge wisely, or feelprecisely what it would be wise to feel, in relation to this presentworld and state of being; but it is because you are too delicately andexquisitely wrought in heart, mind, and frame, to dwell in such aworld--because, in short, you are fitter to be in Paradise than here
You needed, therefore, an interpreter between the world andyourself--one who should sometimes set you right, not in the abstract(for there you are never wrong) but relatively to human and earthlymatters;--and such an interpreter is your husband, who can sympathise,though inadequately, with his wife's heavenly nature, and has likewisea portion of shrewd earthly sense, enough to guide us both through thelabyrinths of time
 Now, dearest, when I criticise any act, word,thought, or feeling of yours, you must not understand it as a reproof,or as imputing anything wrong, wherewith you are to burthen yourconscience
 Were an angel, however holy and wise, to come and dwellwith mortals, he would need the guidance and instruction of somemortal; and so will you, my Dove, need mine--and precisely the samesort of guidance that the angel would
 Then do not grieve, nor grieveyour husband's spirit, when he essays to do his office; but rememberthat he does it reverently, and in the devout belief that you are, inimmortal reality, both wiser and better than himself, though sometimeshe may chance to interpret the flitting shadows around us moreaccurately than you
 Hear what I say, dearest, in a cheerful spirit,and act upon it with cheerful strength
 And do not give an undueweight to my judgment, nor imagine that there is no appeal from it,and that its decrees are not to be questioned
 Rather, make it a rulealways to question them and be satisfied of their correctness;--and soshall my Dove be improved and perfected in the gift of a humanunderstanding, till she become even earthly-wiselier than hersagacious husband
 Undine's husband gave her an immortal soul; mybeloved wife must be content with an humbler gift from me, beingalready provided with as high and pure a soul as ever was created
God bless you, belovedest
 I bestow three kisses on the air--they areintended for your eyelids and brow, to drive away the head-ache
     YOUR OWNEST
          Custom-House, Novr
 30th [1839]     Mine own Dove,You will have received my letter, dearest, ere now, and I trust thatit will have conveyed the peace of my own heart into yours; for myheart is too calm and peaceful in the sense of our mutual love, to bedisturbed even by my sweetest wife's disquietude
 Belovedest andblessedest, I cannot feel anything but comfort in you
 Rest quietly onmy deep, deep, deepest affection
 You deserve it all, and infinitelymore than all, were it only for the happiness you give me
 Iapprehended that this cup could not pass from you, without yourtasting bitterness among its dregs
 You have been too calm, mybeloved--you have exhausted your strength
 Let your soul lean upon mylove, till we meet again--then all your troubles shall be hushed
     Your ownest, happiest,     DEODATUS

     My Dearest,The day must not pass without my speaking a word or two to mybelovedest wife, of whom I have thought, with tender anxieties mingledwith comfortable hopes, all day long
 Dearest, is your heart at peacenow? God grant it--and I have faith that He will communicate the peaceof my heart to yours
 Mine own wife, always when there is troublewithin you, let your husband know of it
 Strive to fling your burthenupon me; for there is strength enough in me to bear it all, and loveenough to make me happy in bearing it
 I will not give up any of myconjugal rights--and least of all this most precious right ofministering to you in all sorrow
 My bosom was made, among otherpurposes, for mine ownest wife to shed tears upon
 This I have known,ever since we were married--and I had yearnings to be your support andcomforter, even before I knew that God was uniting our spirits inimmortal wedlock
 I used to think that it would be happiness enough,food enough for my heart, it I could be the life-long, familiar friendof your family, and be allowed to see yourself every evening, and towatch around you to keep harm away--though you might never know whatan interest I felt in you
 And how infinitely more than this has beengranted me! Oh, never dream, blessedest wife, that you can be otherthan a comfort to your husband--or that he can be disappointed in you
Mine own Dove, I hardly know how it is, but nothing that you do or sayever surprises or disappoints me; it must be that my spirit is sothoroughly and intimately conscious of you, that there exists latentwithin me a prophetic knowledge of all your vicissitudes of joy orsorrow; so that, though I cannot foretell them before-hand, yet Irecognize them when they come
 Nothing disturbs the preconceived ideaof you in my mind
 Whether in bliss or agony, still you are mine ownDove--still my blessing--still my peace
 Belovedest, since theforegoing sentence, I have been interrupted; so I will leave the restof the sheet till tomorrow evening
 Good night, and in writing thesewords my soul has flown through the air to give you a fondest kiss
Did you not feel it?Decr
 2d
--Your letter came to me at the Custom-House, very dearest,at about eleven o'clock; and I opened it with an assured hope offinding good news about my Dove; for I had trusted very much in SophieHawthorne's assistance
 Well, I am afraid I shall never find in myheart to call that excellent little person "Naughty" again--no; and Ihave even serious thoughts of giving up all further designs upon hernose, since she hates so much to have it kissed
 Yet the poor littlenose!--would it not be quite depressed (I do not mean flattened) by myneglect, after becoming accustomed to such marked attention? Andbesides, I have a particular affection for that nose, insomuch that Iintend, one of these days, to offer it an oblation of rich anddelicate odours
 But I suppose Sophie Hawthorne would apply herhandkerchief, so that the poor nose should reap no pleasure nor profitfrom my incense
 Naughty Sophie Hawthorne! There--I have called her"naughty" already--and on a mere supposition, too
Half a page of nonsense about Sophie Hawthorne's nose! And now have Ianything to say to my little Dove? Yes--a reproof
 My Dove is tounderstand, that she entirely exceeds her jurisdiction, in presumingto sit in judgment upon herself, and pass such severe censure as shedid upon her Friday's letter--or indeed any censure at all
 It washer bounden duty to write that letter; for it was the cry of herheart, which ought and must have reached her husband's ears, whereverin the world he might be
 And yet you call it wicked
 Was it SophieHawthorne or the Dove that called it so? Naughty SophieHawthorne--naughty Dove--for I believe they are both partakers of thisnaughtiness
Dearest, I have never had the good luck to profit much, or indeed any,by attending lectures; so that I think the ticket had better bebestowed on somebody who can listen to Mr
 Emerson more worthily
 Myevenings are very precious to me; and some of them are unavoidablythrown away in paying or receiving visits, or in writing letters ofbusiness; and therefore I prize the rest as if the sands of thehour-glass were gold or diamond dust
 I have no other time to sit inmy parlor (let me call it ours) and be happy by our ownfireside--happy in reveries about a certain little wife of mine, whowould fain have me spend my evenings in hearing lectures, lest Ishould incommode her with too frequent epistles
Good bye, dearest
 I suppose I have left a dozen questions in yourletter unanswered; but you shall ask them again when we meet
 Do notyou long to see me? Mercy on us,--what a pen! It looks as if I hadlaid a strong emphasis on that sentence
 God bless my Dove, and SophieHawthorne too

     Dearest wife,I do wish that you would evince the power of your spirit over itsoutward manifestations, in some other way than by raising aninflammation over your eye
 Do, belovedest, work another miracleforthwith, and cause this mountain--for I fancy it as of reallymountainous bulk--cause it to be cast into the sea, or anywhere else;so that both eyes may greet your husband, when he comes home
Otherwise, I know not but my eyes will have an inflammation too;--theycertainly smarted in a very unwonted manner, last evening
 "Thenaughty swelling!" as my Dove (or Sophie Hawthorne) said of theswollen cheek that afflicted me last summer
 Will kisses have anyefficacy? No; I am afraid not, for if they were medicinal, my Dove'seyelids have been so imbued with them that no ill would have comethere
 Nevertheless, though not a preventive, a kiss may chance tobe a remedy
 Can Sophie Hawthorne be prevailed upon to let me try it?I went to see my wife's (and of course my own) sister Mary, on Tuesdayevening
 She appeared very well; and we had a great deal of good talk,wherein my Dove was not utterly forgotten--(now will Sophie Hawthorne,thinking the Dove slighted, pout her lip at that expression)--wellthen, my Dove was directly or indirectly concerned in all my thoughts,and most of my words
 Mrs
 Park was not there, being gone, I believe,to some lecture
 Mary and your husband talked with the utmosthopefulness and faith of my Dove's future health and well-being
Dearest, you are well (all but the naughty swelling) and you alwayswill be well
 I love Mary because she loves you so much;--ouraffections meet in you, and so we become kindred
 But everybody lovesmy Dove--everybody that knows her--and those that know her not loveher also, though unconsciously, whenever they image to themselvessomething sweeter, and tenderer, and nobler, than they can meet withon earth
 It is the likeness of my Dove that has haunted the dreams ofpoets, ever since the world began
 Happy me, to whom that dream hasbecome the reality of all realities--whose bosom has been warmed, andis forever warmed, with the close embrace of her who has flittedshadowlike away from all other mortals! Dearest, I wish your husbandhad the gift of making rhymes; for methinks there is poetry in hishead and heart, since he has been in love with you
 You are a Poem, myDove
 Of what sort, then? Epic?--Mercy on me,--no! A sonnet?--no; forthat is too labored and artificial
 My Dove is a sort of sweet,simple, gay, pathetic ballad, which Nature is singing, sometimes withtears, sometimes with smiles, and sometimes with intermingled smilesand tears
I was invited to dine at Mr
 Bancroft's yesterday with Miss MargaretFuller; but Providence had given me some business to do; for which Iwas very thankful
 When my Dove and Sophie Hawthorne can go with me, Ishall not be afraid to accept invitations to meet literary lions andlionesses, because then I shall put the above-said redoubtable littlepersonage in the front of the battle
 What do you think, Dearest, ofthe expediency of my making a caucus speech? A great many people arevery desirous of listening to your husband's eloquence; and that isconsidered the best method of making my debut
 Now, probably, willSophie Hawthorne utterly refuse to be kissed, unless I give up allnotion of speechifying at a caucus
 Silly little Sophie!--I wouldnot do it, even if thou thyself besought it of me
Belovedest, I wish, before declining your ticket to Mr
 Emerson'slectures, that I had asked whether you wished me to attend them; forif you do, I should have more pleasure in going, than if the wish wereoriginally my own
Dearest wife, nobody can come within the circle of my loneliness, saveyou;--you are my only companion in the world;--at least, when Icompare other intercourse with our intimate communion, it seems as[if] other people were the world's width asunder
 And yet I love allthe world better for my Dove's sake
Good bye, belovedest
 Drive away that "naughty swelling

     Belovedest,I am afraid you will expect a letter tomorrow--afraid, because I feelvery sure that I shall not be able to fill this sheet tonight
 I amwell, and happy, and I love you dearly, sweetest wife;--nevertheless,it is next to impossibility for me to put ideas into words
 Even inwriting these two or three lines, I have fallen into several long fitsof musing
 I wish there was something in the intellectual worldanalogous to the Daguerrotype (is that the name of it?) in thevisible--something which should print off our deepest, and subtlest,and delicatest thoughts and feelings as minutely and accurately as theabove-mentioned instrument paints the various aspects of Nature
 Thenmight my Dove and I interchange our reveries--but my Dove would getonly lead in exchange for gold
 Dearest, your last letter brought thewarmth of your very heart to your husband--Belovedest, I cannotpossibly write one word more, to-night
This striving to talk on paper does but remove you farther from me
 Itseems as if Sophie Hawthorne fled away into infinite space the momentI try to fix her image before me in order to inspire my pen;--whereas,no sooner do I give myself up to reverie, than here she is again,smiling lightsomely by my side
 There will be no writing of letters inHeaven; at least, I shall write none then, though I think it would addconsiderably to my bliss to receive them from my Dove
 Never was I sostupid as to-night;--and yet it is not exactly stupidity, either, formy fancy is bright enough, only it has, just at this time, no commandof external symbols
 Good night, dearest wife
 Love your husband, anddream of him

 Blessedest--Dove-ward and Sophie Hawthorne-warddoth your husband acknowledge himself "very reprehensible," forleaving his poor wife destitute of news from him such an interminabletime--one, two, three, four days tomorrow noon
 After seven years'absence, without communication, a marriage, if I mistake not, isdeemed to be legally dissolved
 Does it not appear at least sevenyears to my Dove, since we parted? It does to me
 And will my Dove, ornaughty Sophie Hawthorne, choose to take advantage of the law, anddeclare our marriage null and void? Oh, naughty, naughty, naughtiestSophie Hawthorne, to suffer such an idea to come into your head! TheDove, I am sure, would not disown her husband, but would keep herheart warm with faith and love for a million of years; so that when hereturned to her (as he surely would, at some period of Eternity, tospend the rest of eternal existence with her) he would seem to find inher bosom the warmth which his parting embrace had left there
Very dearest, I do wish you would come to see me, this evening
 If wecould be together in this very parlour of ours, I think you, and bothof us, would feel more completely at home than we ever have before inall our lives
 Your chamber is but a room in your mother's house,where my Dove cannot claim an independent and separate right; she hasa right, to be sure, but it is as a daughter
 As a wife, it might be aquestion whether she has a right
 Now this pleasant little room, whereI sit, together with the bed-room in which I intend to dream tonightof my Dove, is my dwelling, my castle, mine own place wherein to be,which I have bought, for the time being, with the profits of mine ownlabor
 Then is it not our home?     (Rest of letter missing)     , Decr

     Belovedest,I wish you could see our parlour to-night--how bright and cheerful itlooks, with the blaze of the coal-fire throwing a ruddy tinge over thewalls, in spite of the yellow gleam of two lamps
 Now if my Dove weresitting in the easiest of our two easy chairs--(for sometimes I shouldchoose to have her sit in a separate chair, in order to realise ourindividuality, as well as our unity)--then would the included space ofthese four walls, together with the little contiguous bed-room, seemindeed like home
--But the soul of home is wanting now
 Oh,naughtiest, why are you not here to welcome your husband when he comesin at eventide, chilled with his wintry day's toil? Why does he notfind the table placed cosily in front of the fire, and a cup of teasteaming fragrantly--or else a bowl of warm bread and milk, such ashis Dove feeds upon? A much-to-be-pitied husband am I, naughtywife--a homeless man--a wanderer in the desert of this great city;picking up a precarious subsistence wherever I happen to find arestaurateur or an oyster-shop--and returning at night to a lonelyfireside
 Dearest, have I brought the tears into your eyes? What anunwise little person is my Dove, to let the tears gather in her eyesfor such nonsensical pathos as this! Yet not nonsensical either,inasmuch as it is a sore trial to your husband to be estranged fromthat which makes life a reality to him, and to be compelled to spendso many God-given days in a dream--in an outward show, which hasnothing to satisfy the soul that has become acquainted with truth
But, mine own wife, if you had not taught me what happiness is, Ishould not have known that there is anything lacking to me now
 I amdissatisfied--not because, at any former period of my life, I was evera thousandth part so happy as now--but because Hope feeds and growsstrong on the happiness within me
 Good night, belovedest wife
 I havea note to write to Mr
 Capen, who torments me every now-and-then abouta book which he wants me to manufacture
 Hereafter, I intend that myDove shall manage all my correspondence:--indeed, it is my purpose tothrow all sorts of trouble upon my Dove's shoulders
 Good night now,dearest

 Blessedest wife--has not Sophie Hawthorne beenvery impatient for this letter, one half of which yet remainsundeveloped in my brain and heart? Would that she could enter thoseinward regions, and read the letter there--together with so much thatnever can be expressed in written or spoken words
 And can she not dothis? The Dove can do it, even if Sophie Hawthorne fail
 Dearest,would it be unreasonable for me to ask you to manage my share of thecorrespondence, as well as your own?--to throw yourself into my heart,and make it gush out with more warmth and freedom than my own pen canavail to do? How I should delight to see an epistle from myself toSophie Hawthorne, written by my Dove!--or to my Dove, Sophie Hawthornebeing the amanuensis! I doubt not, that truths would then be spoken,which my heart would recognise as existing within its depths, yetwhich can never be clothed in words of my own
 You know that we areone another's consciousness--then it is not poss--My dearest, GeorgeHillard has come in upon me, in the midst of the foregoing sentence,and I have utterly forgotten what I meant to say
 But it is not muchmatter
 Even if I could convince you of the expediency of yourwriting my letters as well as your own, still, when you attempted totake the pen out of my hand, I believe I should resist verystrenuously
 For, belovedest, though not an epistolarian by nature,yet the instinct of communicating myself to you makes it a necessityand a joy to write
Your husband has received an invitation, through Mr
 CollectorBancroft, to go to Dr
 Channing's to-night
 What is to be done?Anything, rather than to go
 I never will venture into company, unlessI can put myself under the protection of Sophie Hawthorne
 She, I amsure, will take care that no harm comes to me
 Or my Dove might takeme "under her wing
"Dearest, you must not expect me too fervently on Christmas eve,because it is very uncertain whether Providence will bring us togetherthen
 If not, I shall take care to advise you thereof byletter--which, however, may chance not to come to hand till threeo'clock on Christmas day
 And there will be my Dove, making herselfnervous with waiting for me
 Dearest, I wish I could be the source ofnothing but happiness to you--and that disquietude, hope deferred, anddisappointment, might not ever have aught to do with your affection
Does the joy compensate for the pain? Naughty Sophie Hawthorne--sillyDove--will you let that foolish question bring tears into your eyes?My Dove's letter was duly received

     My very dearest,While I sit down disconsolately to write this letter, at this verymoment is my Dove expecting to hear her husband's footstep upon thethreshold
 She fully believes, that, within the limits of the hourwhich is now passing, she will be clasped to my bosom
 Belovedest, Icannot bear to have you yearn for me so intensely
 By and bye, whenyou find that I do not come, our head will begin to ache;--but still,being the "hopingest little person" in the world, you will not give meup, perhaps till eight o'clock
 But soon it will be bed-time--it willbe deep night--and not a spoken word, not a written line, will havecome to your heart from your naughtiest of all husbands
 SophieHawthorne, at least, will deem him the naughtiest of husbands; but myDove will keep her faith in him just as firmly and fervently, as ifshe were acquainted with the particular impossibilities which keephim from her
 Dearest wife, I did hope, till this afternoon, that Ishould be able to disburthen myself of the cargo of salt which hasbeen resting on my weary shoulders for a week past; but it does seemas if Heaven's mercy were not meant for us miserable Custom-Houseofficers
 The holiest of holydays--the day that brought ransom to allother sinners--leaves us in slavery still
Nevertheless, dearest, if I did not feel two disappointments inone--your own and mine--I should feel much more comfortable andresigned than I do
 If I could have come to you to-night, I mustinevitably have returned hither tomorrow evening
 But now, in requitalof my present heaviness of spirit, I am resolved that my next visitshall be at least one day longer than I could otherwise have venturedto make it
 We cannot spend this Christmas eve together, mine ownwife; but I have faith that you will see me on the eve of the NewYear
 Will not you be glad when I come home to spend three whole days,that I was kept away from you for a few brief hours on Christmas eve?For if I went now, I could not be with you then
My blessedest, write and let me know that you have not been very muchdisturbed by my non-appearance
 I pray you to have the feelings of awife towards me, dearest--that is, you must feel that my whole life isyours, a life-time of long days, and therefore it is no irreparablenor very grievous loss, though sometimes a few of those days arewasted away from you
 A wife should be calm and quiet, in the settledcertainty of possessing her husband
 Above all, dearest, bear thesecrosses with philosophy for my sake; for it makes me anxious anddepressed, to imagine your anxiety and depression
 Oh, that you couldbe very joyful when I come, and yet not sad when I fail to come! Isthat impossible, my sweetest Dove?--is it impossible, my naughtiestSophie Hawthorne?Your husband's heart was exceedingly touched by that little backhandednote, and likewise by the bundle of allumettes--half a dozen of whichI have just been kissing with great affection
 Would that I might kissthat poor dear finger of mine! Kiss it for my sake, sweetest Dove--andtell naughty Sophie Hawthorne to kiss it too
 Nurse it well, dearest;for no small part of my comfort and cheeriness of heart depends uponthat beloved finger
 If it be not well enough to bear its part inwriting me a letter within a few days, do not be surprised if I senddown the best surgeon in  to effect a speedy cure
 Nevertheless,darlingest wife, restrain the good little finger, if it show anyinclination to recommence its labors too soon
 If your finger bepained in writing, your husband's heart ought to (and I hope would)feel every twinge
Belovedest, I have not yet wished you a Happy New Year! And yet Ihave--many, many of them; as many, mine own wife, as we can enjoytogether--and when we can no more enjoy them together, we shall nolonger think of Happy New Years on earth, but look longingly for theNew Year's Day of eternity
 What a year the last has been! Dearest,you make the same exclamation; but my heart originates it too
 It hasbeen the year of years--the year in which the flower of our life hasbloomed out--the flower of our life and of our love, which we are towear in our bosoms forever
 Oh, how I love you, belovedest wife!--andhow I thank God that He has made me capable to know and love you!Sometimes I feel, deep, deep down in my heart, how dearest above allthings you are to me; and those are blissful moments
 It is such ahappiness to be conscious, at last, of something real
 All my lifehitherto, I have been walking in a dream, among shadows which couldnot be pressed to my bosom; but now, even in this dream of time, thereis something that takes me out of it, and causes me to be a dreamer nomore
 Do you not feel, dearest, that we live above time and apart fromtime, even while we seem to be in the midst of time? Our affectiondiffuses eternity round about us
My carefullest little wife will rejoice to know that I have been freeto sit by a good fire all this bitter cold day--not but what I have asalt-ship on my hands, but she must have some ballast, before she candischarge any more salt; and ballast cannot be procured till the dayafter tomorrow
 Are not these details very interesting? I have a mind,some day, to send my dearest a journal of all my doings andsufferings, my whole external life, from the time I awake at dawn,till I close my eyes at night
 What a dry, dull history would it be!But then, apart from this, I would write another journal of my inwardlife throughout the self-same day--my fits of pleasant thought, andthose likewise which are shadowed by passing clouds--the yearnings ofmy heart towards my Dove--my pictures of what we are to enjoytogether
 Nobody would think that the same man could live two suchdifferent lives simultaneously
 But then, as I have said above, thegrosser life is a dream, and the spiritual life a reality
Very dearest, I wish you would make out a list of books that you wouldlike to be in our library; for I intend, whenever the cash and theopportunity occur together, to buy enough to fill up our newbook-case; and I want to feel that I am buying them for both of us
When I next come to Salem, you shall read the list, and we willdiscuss it, volume by volume
 I suppose the book-case will holdabout two hundred volumes; but you need not calculate upon making sucha vast collection all at once
 It shall be accomplished in small lots;and then we shall prize every volume, and receive a separate pleasurefrom the acquisition of it
Does it seem a great while since I left you, dearest? Truly, it doesto me
 These separations lengthen our earthly lives by at leastnine-tenths; but then, in our brief seasons of communion, there is theessence of a thousand years
 Was it Thursday that I told my Dove wouldbe the day of my next appearance?--or Friday? "Oh, Friday, certainly!"says Sophie Hawthorne
 Well; it must be as naughty Sophie says
Oh, belovedest, I want you
 You have given me a new feeling,blessedest wife--a sense, that strong as I may have deemed myself, Iam insufficient for my own support; and that there is a tender littleDove, without whose help I cannot get through this weary world at all
God bless you, ownest wife
     YOUR OWNEST HUSBAND
What a best of all possible husbands you have, sweetest wife, to bewriting to you so soon again, although he has heard nothing from yousince the latter part of the year 1839! What a weary length of timethat naughty finger has been ill! Unless there are signs of speedyamendment, we must begin to think of "rotation in office," and theleft hand must be nominated to the executive duties of which the rightis no longer capable
 Yet, dearest, do not imagine that I amimpatient
 I do indeed long to see your delicatest little penmanship;(what an enormity it would be to call my Dove's most feminine ofhandwritings penmanship!) but it would take away all the happinessof it, when I reflected that each individual letter had been a pain toyou
 Nay; I would not have you write, if you find that the impedimentsof this mode of utterance check the flow of your mind and heart
But you tell me that the wounded finger will be no hindrance to yourpainting
 Very glad am I, dearest; for you cannot think how muchdelight those pictures are going to give me
 I shall sit and gaze atthem whole hours together--and these will be my happiest hours, thefullest of you, though all are full of you
 I never owned a picture inmy life; yet pictures have always been among the earthly possessions(and they are spiritual possessions too) which I most coveted
 I knownot what value my Dove's pictures might bear at an auction-room; butto me, certainly, they will be incomparably more precious than all theproductions of all the painters since Apelles
 When we live togetherin our own home, belovedest, we will paint pictures together--that is,our minds and hearts shall unite to form the conception, to which yourhand shall give material existence
 I have often felt as if I could bea painter, only I am sure that I could never handle a brush;--now myDove will show me the images of my inward eye, beautified andetherealised by the mixture of her own spirit
 Belovedest, I think Ishall get these two pictures put into mahogany frames, because theywill harmonize better with the furniture of our parlor than giltframes would
While I was writing the foregoing paragraph, Mary has sent to inquirewhether I mean to go to Salem tomorrow, intending, if I did, to send aletter by me
 But, alas! I am not going
 The inquiry, however, hasmade me feel a great yearning to be there
 But it is not possible,because I have an engagement at Cambridge on Saturday evening; andeven if it were otherwise, it would be better to wait till the middleof the week, or a little later, when I hope to spend three or fourdays with you
 Oh, what happiness, when we shall be able to lookforward to an illimitable time in each other's society--when a day ortwo of absence will be far more infrequent than the days which wespend together now
 Then a quiet will settle down upon us, apassionate quiet, which is the consummation of happiness
Dearest, I hope you have not found it impracticable to walk, thoughthe atmosphere be so wintry
 Did we walk together in any such coldweather, last winter? I believe we did
 How strange, that such aflower as our affection should have blossomed amid snow and wintrywinds--accompaniments which no poet or novelist, that I know of, hasever introduced into a love-tale
 Nothing like our story was everwritten--or ever will be--for we shall not feel inclined to make thepublic our confidant; but if it could be told, methinks it would besuch as the angels might take delight to hear
 If I mistake not, myDove has expressed some such idea as this, in one of her recentletters
Well-a-day! I have strolled thus far through my letter, without oncemaking mention of naughty Sophie Hawthorne
 Will she pardon theneglect? Present my profound respects to her beloved nose, and saythat I still entreat her to allow my Dove to kiss her cheek
 When shecomplies with this oft-repeated petition, I shall hope that her spiritis beginning to be tamed, and shall then meditate some other and moredifficult trials of it
 Nonsense! Do not believe me, dear littleSophie Hawthorne
 I would not tame you for the whole Universe
But now good bye, dearest wife
 Keep yourself in good heart while I amabsent, and grow round and plump and rosy;--eat a whole chicken everyday;--go to bed at nine o'clock or earlier, and sleep sound tillsunrise
 Come to me in dreams, beloved
 What should I do in this wearyworld, without the idea of you, dearest! Give my love to your fatherand mother, and to Elizabeth
     God bless you, darling
     YOUR OWNEST HUSBAND
Your letter came this forenoon, announcing the advent of the pictures;so I came home as soon as I possibly could--and there was the package!I naturally trembled as I undid it, so eager was I to behold them
Dearissima, there never was anything so lovely and precious in thisworld
 They are perfect
 So soon as the dust and smoke of my fire hadevaporated, I put them on the mantelpiece, and sat a long time beforethem with clasped hands, gazing, and gazing, and gazing, and paintinga fac-simile of them in my heart, in whose most sacred chamber theyshall keep a place forever and ever
 Belovedest, I was not long infinding out the Dove in the Menaggio
 In fact, she was the very firstobject that my eyes rested on, when I uncovered the picture
 She flewstraightway into my heart--and yet she remains just where you placedher
 Dearest, if it had not been for your strict injunctions thatnobody nor anything should touch the pictures, I do believe that mylips would have touched that naughty Sophie Hawthorne, as she standson the bridge
 Do you think the perverse little damsel would havevanished beneath my kiss? What a misfortune would that have been toher poor lover!--to find that he kissed away his mistress
 But, atworst, she would have remained on my lips
 However, I shall refrainfrom all endearments, till you tell me that a kiss may be hazardedwithout fear of her taking it in ill part and absenting herselfwithout leave
Mine ownest, it is a very noble-looking cavalier with whom Sophie isstanding on the bridge
 Are you quite sure that her own husband is thecompanion of her walk? Yet I need not ask--for there is the Dove tobear witness to his identity
 That true and tender bird would neverhave alighted on another hand--never have rested so near anotherbosom
 Yes; it must be my very self; and from henceforth it shall beheld for an absolute and indisputable truth
 It is not my picture, butthe very I; and as my inner self belongs to you, there is no doubtthat you have caused my soul to pervade the figure
 There we are,unchangeable
 Years cannot alter us, nor our relation to each other
Ownest, we will talk about these pictures all our lives and longer; sothere is no need that I should say all that I think and feel aboutthem now; especially as I have yet only begun to understand and feelthem
 I have put them into my bed-room for the present, being afraidto trust them on the mantel-piece; but I cannot help going to feast myeyes upon them, every little while
 I have determined not to hang themup till after I have been to Salem, for fear of the dust and of thefingers of the chamber-maid and other visitants
 Whenever I am away,they will be safely locked up, either in the bureau or in my closet
 Ishall want your express directions as to the height at which theyought to be hung, and the width of the space between them, and otherminutest particulars
 We will discuss these matters, when I come hometo my wife
Belovedest, there are several obstacles to my coming home immediately
At present, two of the Measurers are employed, and another is detainedat his home in Chelsea by the sickness of his family, and Colonel Hallcontinues too unwell to be at the Custom-House; so that I am the onlyone in attendance there; and moreover I have a coal vessel todischarge to-morrow
 But this state of affairs will not continue long
I think I cannot fail to be at liberty by Tuesday or Wednesday atfurthest; and at all events, next week shall not pass without ourmeeting; even if I should have barely time to press you in my arms,and say goodbye
 But the probability is, that I shall come to spend aweek
Dearissima, be patient--Sophie Hawthorne as well as the Dove
My carefullest little wife, I am of opinion that Elizabeth has beenmisinformed as to the increased prevalence of the small-pox
 It couldnot be so generally diffused among the merchants and business-peoplewithout my being aware of it; nor do I hear of its committing suchfearful ravages anywhere
 The folks at the Custom-House know of nosuch matter; nor does George Hillard
 In truth, I had supposed (till Iheard otherwise from you) that all cause for alarm was past
 Trust me,dearest, there is no need of heart-quake on my account
 You have beenin greater danger than your husband
God be with you, blessedest and blessingest
 I did 


     (Remainder of letter missing)Can you reckon the ages that have elapsed since our last embrace? Itquite surpasses my powers of computation
 I only know that, in somelong by-gone time, I had a wife--and that now I am a widowed man,living not in the present, but in the past and future
 My life wouldbe empty indeed, if I could neither remember nor anticipate; but I cando both; and so my heart continues to keep itself full of light andwarmth
 Belovedest, let it be so likewise with you
 You promisedme--did you not?--to be happy during our separation, and really I mustinsist upon holding you to your word even if it should involve amiracle
Dearest, I have hung up the pictures--the Isola over the mantel-piece,and the Menaggio on the opposite wall
 This arrangement pleased mebetter, on the whole, than the other which we contemplated; and Icannot perceive but that the light is equally favorable for them both
You cannot imagine how they glorify our parlor--and what a solace theyare to its widowed inhabitant
 I sit before them with something of thequiet and repose which your own beloved presence is wont to impart tome
 I gaze at them by all sorts of light--daylight, twilight, andcandle-light; and when the lamps are extinguished, and before gettinginto bed, I sit looking at these pictures, by the flickeringfire-light
 They are truly an infinite enjoyment
 I take great care ofthem, and have hitherto hung the curtains before them every morning;and they remain covered till after I have kindled my fire in theafternoon
 But I suppose this precaution need not be taken muchlonger
 I think that this slight veil produces a not unpleasingeffect, especially upon the Isola--a gentle and tender gloom, like thefirst approaches of twilight
 Nevertheless, whenever I remove thecurtains I am always struck with new surprise at the beauty which thengleams forth
 Mine ownest, you are a wonderful little Dove
What beautiful weather this is--beautiful, at least, so far as sun,sky, and atmosphere are concerned; though a poor wingless biped, likemy Dove's husband, is sometimes constrained to wish that he couldraise himself a little above the earth
 How much mud and mire, howmany pools of unclean water, how many slippery footsteps and perchanceheavy tumbles, might be avoided, if we could but tread six inchesabove the crust of this world
 Physically, we cannot do this; ourbodies cannot; but it seems to me that our hearts and minds may keepthemselves above moral mud-puddles, and other discomforts of thesoul's path-way, and so enjoy the sunshine
I have added Coleridge's Poems, a very good edition in three volumes,to our library
 Dearest, dearest, what a joy it is to think of you,whenever I buy a book--to think that we shall read them aloud to oneanother, and that they are to be our mutual and familiar friends forlife
 I intended to have asked you again for that list which youshewed me; but it will do the next time I come
 I mean to go to abook-auction this evening
 When our book-case is filled, mybibliomania will probably cease; for its shelves, I think, would holdabout all the books that I should care to read--all, at least, that Ishould wish to possess as household friends
What a reprehensible husband am I, not to have inquired, in the veryfirst sentence of my letter, whether my belovedest has quiterecovered from the varioloid! But, in truth, it seemed so long sincewe parted, that none but chronic diseases can have subsisted from thattime to this
 I make no doubt, therefore, but that the afflicted armis entirely recovered, and that only a slight scar remains--whichshall be kissed, some time or other
 And how are your eyes, myblessedest? Do not torture them by attempting to write, before theyare quite well
 If you inflict pain on them for such a purpose, yourhusband's eyes will be sensible of it, when he shall read yourletters
 Remember that we have now a common property in each other'seyes
Dearest, I have not seen Colonel Hall since my return hither--he beinggone to Maine
 When he comes back, or shortly thereafter, I will tryto prevail on your neglectful spouse to pay you a short visit
Methinks he is a very cold and loveless sort of person
 I have beenpestering him, ever since I began this letter, to send you some wordof affectionate remembrance; but he utterly refuses to send anything,save a kiss apiece to the Dove's eyes and mouth, and to SophieHawthorne's nose and foot
 Will you have the kindness to see thatthese valuable consignments arrive at their destination? Dearestwife, the letter-writer belies your ownest husband
 He thinks of you,and yearns for you all day long
  Your letter, with its assurance of your present convalescence, and itspromise (to which I shall hold you fast) that you will never be sickany more, caused me much joy



 Dearest, George Hillard came in justas I had written the first sentence; so we will begin on a new score
Your husband has been measuring coal all day, aboard of a black littleBritish schooner, in a dismal dock at the north end of the city
 Mostof the time, he paced the deck to keep himself warm; for the wind(north-east, I believe it was) blew up through the dock, as if it hadbeen the pipe of a pair of bellows
 The vessel lying deep between twowharves, there was no more delightful prospect, on the right hand andon the left, than the posts and timbers, half immersed in the water,and covered with ice, which the rising and falling of successive tideshad left upon them; so that they looked like immense icicles
 Acrossthe water, however, not more than half a mile off, appeared the BunkerHill monument; and what interested me considerably more, achurch-steeple, with the dial of a clock upon it, whereby I wasenabled to measure the march of the weary hours
 Sometimes yourhusband descended into the dirty little cabin of the schooner, andwarmed himself by a red-hot stove, among biscuit-barrels, pots andkettles, sea-chests, and innumerable lumber of all sorts--hisolfactories, meanwhile, being greatly refreshed by the odour of apipe, which the captain or some of his crew were smoking
 But at lastcame the sunset, with delicate clouds, and a purple light upon theislands; and your husband blessed it, because it was the signal of hisrelease; and so he came home to talk with his dearest wife
 And now hebids her farewell, because he is tired and sleepy
 God bless you,belovedest
 Dream happy dreams of me tonight
February 12th--Evening
--All day long again, best wife, has your poorhusband been engaged in a very black business--as black as a coal; andthough his face and hands have undergone a thorough purification, hefeels as if he were not altogether fit to hold communion with hiswhite Dove
 Methinks my profession is somewhat akin to that of achimney-sweeper; but the latter has the advantage over me, because,after climbing up through the darksome flue of the chimney, he emergesinto the midst of the golden air, and sings out his melodies far overthe heads of the whole tribe of weary earth-plodders
 My dearest, mytoil today has been cold and dull enough; nevertheless your husbandwas neither cold nor dull; for he kept his heart warm and his spiritbright with thoughts of his belovedest wife
 I had strong and happyyearnings for you to-day, ownest Dove--happy, even though it was suchan eager longing, which I knew could not then be fulfilled, to claspyou to my bosom
 And now here I am in our parlour, aweary--too tired,almost, to write
Well, dearest, my labors are over for the present
 I cannot, however,come home just at present, three of the Measurers being now absent;but you shall see me very soon
 Naughtiest, why do you say that youhave scarcely seen your husband, this winter? Have there not, to saynothing of shorter visits, been two eternities of more than a weekeach, which were full of blessings for us? My Dove has quite forgottenthese
 Oh, well! If visits of a week long be not worth remembering, Ishall alter my purpose of coming to Salem for another likespace;--otherwise I might possibly have been there, by Saturday night,at furthest
 Dear me, how sleepy I am! I can hardly write, as you willdiscover by the blottings and scratchings
 So good-bye now,darlingest;--and I will finish in the freshness of the morning
February 13th--Past 8 A
M
 Belovedest, how very soon this letter willbe in your hands
 It brings us much closer together, when the writtenwords of one of us can come to the heart of the other, in the verysame day that they flowed from the heart of the writer
 I mean to comehome to our parlour early to-day; so, when you receive this letter,you can imagine me there, sitting in front of the Isola
 I have thismoment interrupted myself to go and look at that precious production
How I wish that naughty Sophie Hawthorne could be induced to turn herface towards me! Nevertheless, the figure is her veritable self, andso would the face be, only that she deems it too beauteous to bethrown away on her husband's gaze
 I have not dared to kiss her yet
Will she abide it?My dearest, do not expect me very fervently till I come
 I am glad youwere so careful of your inestimable eyes as not to write to meyesterday
 Mrs
 Hillard says that Elizabeth made her a call
Good-bye
 I am very well to day, and unspeakably happy in the thoughtthat I have a dearest little wife, who loves me pretty well
 God blessher
  It seems as if I were looking back to a former state of existence,when I think of the precious hours which we have lived together
 Andnow we are in two different worlds--widowed, both of us--both of usdeceased, and each lamenting 


     (Portion of letter missing)Belovedest, almost my first glance, on entering our parlor after myreturn hither, was at the pictures--my very first glance, indeed, assoon as I had lighted the lamps
 They have certainly grown morebeautiful during my absence, and are still becoming more perfect, andperfecter, and perfectest
 I fancied that Sophie Hawthorne, as shestands on the bridge, had slightly turned her head, so as to revealsomewhat more of her face; but if so, she has since turned it backagain
 I was much struck with the Menaggio this morning;--while I wasgazing at it, the sunshine and the shade grew positively real, and Iagreed with you, for the time, in thinking this a more superlativepicture than the other
 But when I came home about an hour ago, Ibestowed my chiefest attention upon the Isola; and now I believe ithas the first place in my affections, though without prejudice to avery fervent love for the other



 Dove, there is little prospect for me, indeed; but forgive me fortelling you so, dearest--no prospect of my returning so soon as nextMonday; but I have good hope to be again at liberty by the close ofthe week
 Do be very good, my Dove--be as good as your nature willpermit, naughty Sophie Hawthorne
 As to myself, I shall take theliberty to torment myself as much as I please
My dearest, I am very well, but exceedingly stupid and heavy; so theremainder of this letter shall be postponed until tomorrow
 Has myDove flown abroad, this cold, bright day? Would that the wind wouldsnatch her up, and waft her to her husband
How was it, dearest? And how do you do this morning? Is the wind east?The sun shone on the chimney-tops round about here, a few minutes ago;and I hoped that there would be a pleasant day for my Dove to takewing, and for Sophie Hawthorne to ride on horseback; but the skyseems to be growing sullen now
 Do you wish to know how your husbandwill spend the day? First of the first--but there rings the bell foreight o'clock; and I must go down to breakfast
After breakfast;--First of the first, your husband will go to thePost-Office, like a dutiful husband as he is, to put in this letterfor his belovedest wife
 Thence he will proceed to the Custom House,and finding that there is no call for him on the wharves, he will sitdown by the Measurers' fire, and read the Morning Post
 Next, at abouthalf past nine o'clock, he will go to the Athenaeum, and turn over theMagazines and Reviews till eleven or twelve, when it will be time toreturn to the Custom-House to see whether there be a letter from DoveHawthorne--and also (though this is of far less importance) to seewhether there be any demand for his services as Measurer
 At oneo'clock, or thereabouts, he will go to dinner--but first, perhaps, hewill promenade the whole length of Washington street, to get himselfan appetite
 After dinner, he will take one more peep at theCustom-House, and it being by this time about two o'clock, and noprospect of business to-day, he will feel at liberty to come home toour own parlor, there to remain till supper-time
 At six o'clock hewill sally forth again, to get some oysters and read the eveningpapers, and returning between seven and eight, he will read andre-read his belovedest's letter--then take up a book--and go to bed atten, with a blessing on his lips for the Dove and Sophie Hawthorne
Thy letter by Elizabeth came, I believe, on Thursday, and the twowhich thou didst entrust to the post reached me not tillyesterday--whereby I enjoyed a double blessing in recompense of theprevious delay
 Nevertheless, it were desirable that the new Salempostmaster be forthwith ejected, for taking upon himself to withholdthe outpourings of thy heart, at their due season
 As for letters ofbusiness, which involve merely the gain or loss of a few thousanddollars, let him be as careless as he pleases; but when thou wouldstutter thyself to thy husband, dearest wife, there is doubtless apeculiar fitness of thy communications to that point and phase of ourexistence, at which they ought to be received
 However, come when theywill, they are sure to make sweetest music with my heart-strings
Blessedest, what an ugly day is this!--and there thou sittest as heavyas thy husband's heart
 And is his heart indeed heavy? Why no--it isnot heaviness--not the heaviness, like a great lump of ice, which Iused to feel when I was alone in the world--but--but--in short,dearest, where thou art not, there it is a sort of death
 A death,however, in which there is still hope and assurance of a joyful lifeto come
 Methinks, if my spirit were not conscious of thy spirit, thisdreary snow-storm would chill me to torpor;--the warmth of my firesidewould be quite powerless to counteract it
 Most absolute little wife,didst thou expressly command me to go to Father Taylor's church thisvery Sabbath?--(Dinner, or luncheon rather, has intervened since thelast sentence)--Now, belovedest, it would not be an auspicious day forme to hear the aforesaid Son of Thunder
 Thou knowest not howdifficult is thy husband to be touched or moved, unless time, andcircumstances, and his own inward state, be in a "concatenationaccordingly
" A dreadful thing would it be, were Father Taylor to failin awakening a sympathy from my spirit to thine
 Darlingest, pray letme stay at home this afternoon
 Some sunshiny Sunday, when I am wideawake, and warm, and genial, I will go and throw myself open to hisblessed influences; but now, there is but one thing (thou beingabsent) which I feel anywise inclined to do--and that is, to go tosleep
 May I go to sleep, belovedest? Think what sweet dreams of theemay visit me--think how I shall escape this snow-storm--think how myheavy mood will change, as the mood of mind almost always does, duringthe interval that withdraws me from the external world
 Yes; thoubidst me sleep
 Sleep thou too, my beloved--let us pass at one and thesame moment into that misty region, and embrace each other there
Well, dearest, I have slept; but Sophie Hawthorne has beennaughty--she would not be dreamed about
 And now that I am awakeagain, here are the same snow-flakes in the air, that were descendingwhen I went to sleep
 Would that there were an art of making sunshine!Knowest thou any such art? Truly thou dost, my blessedest, and hastoften thrown a heavenly sunshine around thy husband's spirit, when allthings else were full of gloom
 What a woe--what a cloud it is, to beaway from thee! How would my Dove like to have her husband continuallywith her, twelve or fourteen months out of the next twenty? Would notthat be real happiness?--in such long communion, should we not feel asif separation were a dream, something that never had been a reality,nor ever could be? Yes; but--for in all earthly happiness there is abut--but, during those twenty months, there would be two intervals ofthree months each, when thy husband would be five hundred milesaway--as far away as Washington
 That would be terrible
 Would notSophie Hawthorne fight against it?--would not the Dove fold her wings,not in the quietude of bliss, but of despair? Do not be frightened,dearest--nor rejoiced either--for the thing will not be
 It might be,if I chose; but on multitudinous accounts, my present situation seemspreferable; and I do pray, that, in one year more, I may find some wayof escaping from this unblest Custom-House; for it is a very grievousthraldom
 I do detest all offices--all, at least, that are held on apolitical tenure
 And I want nothing to do with politicians--they arenot men; they cease to be men, in becoming politicians
 Their heartswither away, and die out of their bodies
 Their consciences are turnedto India-rubber--or to some substance as black as that, and which willstretch as much
 One thing, if no more, I have gained by myCustom-House experience--to know a politician
 It is a knowledge whichno previous thought, or power of sympathy, could have taught me,because the animal, or the machine rather, is not in nature
Oh my darlingest wife, thy husband's soul yearns to embrace thee! Thouart his hope--his joy--he desires nothing but to be with thee, and totoil for thee, and to make thee a happy wife, wherein would consisthis own heavenliest happiness
 Dost thou love him? Yes; he knoweth it
God bless thee, most beloved
And now good night, best, beautifullest, belovedest, blessingest ofwives
 Notwithstanding what I have said of the fleeting andunsatisfying bliss of dreams, still, if thy husband's prayers andwishes can bring thee, or even a shadow of thee, into his sleep, thouor thy image will assuredly be there
 Good night, ownest
 I bid theegood night, although it is still early in the evening; because I mustreserve the rest of the page to greet thee upon in the morning
Here is thy husband, yearning for thee with his whole heart--thou,meanwhile, being fast asleep, and perhaps hovering around him in thydreams
 Very dreary are the first few centuries which elapse after ourseparations, and before it is time to look forward hopefully toanother meeting--these are the "dark ages
" And hast thou been verygood, my beloved? Dost thou dwell in the past and in the future, sothat the gloomy present is quite swallowed up in sunshine? Do so, mineownest, for the sake of thy husband, whose desire it is to make thywhole life as sunny as the scene beyond those high, dark rocks of theMenaggio
Dearest, my thoughts will not flow at all--they are as sluggish as astream of half-cold lava
 Methinks I could sleep an hour ortwo--perhaps thou art calling to me, out of the midst of thy dream, tocome and join thee there
 I will take a book, and lie down awhile,and perhaps resume my pen in the evening
 I will not say good bye; forI am coming to thee now
March 27th,--Before breakfast
--Good morning, most belovedest
 I feltso infinitely stupid, after my afternoon's nap, that I could notpossibly write another word; and it has required a whole night's sleepto restore me the moderate share of intellect and vivacity thatnaturally belongs to me
 Dearest, thou didst not come into my dreams,last night; but, on the contrary, I was engaged in assisting theescape of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette from Paris, during the Frenchrevolution
 And sometimes, by an unaccountable metamorphosis, itseemed as if my mother and sister were in the place of the King andQueen
 I think that fairies rule over our dreams--beings who have notrue reason or true feeling, but mere fantasies instead of thoseendowments
Afternoon
--Blessedest, I do think that it is the doom laid upon me,of murdering so many of the brightest hours of the day at that unblestCustom-House, that makes such havoc with my wits; for here I am again,trying to write worthily to my etherealest, and intellectualest, andfeelingest, and imaginativest wife, yet with a sense as if all thenoblest part of man had been left out of my composition--or haddecayed out of it, since my nature was given to my own keeping
Sweetest Dove, shouldst thou once venture within those precincts, theatmosphere would immediately be fatal to thee--thy wings would ceaseto flutter in a moment--scarcely wouldst thou have time to nestle intothy husband's bosom, ere thy pure spirit would leave what is mortal ofthee there, and flit away to Heaven
 Never comes any bird of Paradiseinto that dismal region
 A salt, or even a coal-ship is ten milliontimes preferable; for there the sky is above me, and the fresh breezearound me, and my thoughts, having hardly anything to do with myoccupation, are as free as air
Nevertheless, belovedest, thou art not to fancy that the aboveparagraph gives thee a correct idea of thy husband's mental andspiritual state; for he is sometimes prone to the sin of exaggeration
It is only once in a while that the image and desire of a better andhappier life makes him feel the iron of his chain; for after all, ahuman spirit may find no insufficiency of food fit for it, even in theCustom-House
 And with such materials as these, I do think, and feel,and learn things that are worth knowing, and which I should not knowunless I had learned them there; so that the present portion of mylife shall not be quite left out of the sum of my real existence
Moreover, I live through my Dove's heart--I live an intellectual lifein Sophie Hawthorne
 Therefore ought those two in one to keepthemselves happy and healthy in mind and feelings, inasmuch as theyenjoy more blessed influences than their husband, and likewise have toprovide happiness and moral health for him
Very dearest, I feel a great deal better now--nay, nothing whatever isthe matter
 What a foolish husband hast thou, misfortunate littleDove, that he will grieve thee with such a long Jeremiad, and afterall find out that there is not the slightest cause for lamentation
But so it must often be, dearest--this trouble hast thou entailed uponthyself, by yielding to become my wife
 Every cloud that broodsbeneath my sky, or that I even fancy is brooding there, must dim thysunshine too
 But here is no real cloud
 It is good for me, on manyaccounts, that my life has had this passage in it
 Thou canst notthink how much more I know than I did a year ago--what a strongersense I have of power to act as a man among men--what worldly wisdom Ihave gained, and wisdom also that is not altogether of this world
 Andwhen I quit this earthy cavern, where I am now buried, nothing willcling to me that ought to be left behind
 Men will not perceive, Itrust, by my look, or the tenor of my thoughts and feelings, that Ihave been a Custom-House officer
Belovedest!--what an awful concussion was that of our two heads
 Itwas as if two worlds had rushed together--as if the Moon (thou art myMoon, gentlest wife) had met in fierce encounter with the rude,rock-promontoried Earth
 Dearest, art thou sure that thy delicatestbrain has suffered no material harm? A maiden's heart, they say, isoften bruised and broken by her lover's cruelty; it was reserved fornaughtiest me to inflict those injuries upon my mistress's head



     (Portion of letter missing)     Thy Thursday's letter came not till Saturday--so long was thy faithfullest husband defrauded of his rights! Thou mayst imagine how hungrywas my heart, when at last it came
 Thy yesterday's letter, for awonder, arrived in its due season, this forenoon; and I could notrefrain from opening it immediately; and then and there, in thatearthy cavern of the Custom-House, and surrounded by all thosebrawling slang-whangers, I held sweet communion with my Dove
 Dearest,I do not believe that any one of those miserable men ever received aletter which uttered a single word of love and faith--which addresseditself in any manner to the soul
 No beautiful and holy woman's spiritcame to visit any of them, save thy husband
 How blest is he! Thoufindest thy way to him in all dismallest and unloveliest places, andtalkest with him there, nor can the loudest babble nor rudest clamorshut out thy gentle voice from his ear
 Truly, he ought not to bemoanhimself any more, as in his last letter, but to esteem himself favoredbeyond all other mortals;--but truly he is a wayward and incalculablepersonage, and will not be prevailed with to know his own happiness
The lovelier thou art, mine ownest, the more doth thy unreasonablehusband discontent himself to be away from thee, though thoucontinually sendest him all of thyself that can be breathed intowritten words
 Oh, I want thee with me forever and ever!--at least Iwould always have the feeling, amid the tumult and unsuitableassociations of the day, that the night would bring me to my home ofpeace and rest--to thee, my fore-ordained wife
 Well--be patient,heart! The time will come
 Meantime, foolishest heart, be thankful forthe much of happiness thou already hast
Dearest, thy husband was very reprehensible, yesterday
 Wilt thouagain forgive him? He went not to hear Father Taylor preach
 In truth,his own private and quiet room did have such a charm for him, afterbeing mixed and tossed together with discordant elements all the week,that he thought his Dove would grant him indulgence for one moreSabbath
 Also, he fancied himself unfit to go out, on account of acold; though, as the disease has quite disappeared to-day, I am afraidhe conjured it up to serve his naughty purpose
 But, indeed, dearest,I feel somewhat afraid to hear this divine Father Taylor, lest mysympathy with thy admiration of him should be colder and feebler thanthou lookest for
 Belovedest wife, our souls are in happiest unison;but we must not disquiet ourselves if every tone be not re-echoed fromone to the other--if every slightest shade be not reflected in thealternate mirror
 Our broad and general sympathy is enough to secureour bliss, without our following it into minute details
 Wilt thoupromise not to be troubled, should thy husband be unable to appreciatethe excellence of Father Taylor? Promise me this; and at someauspicious hour, which I trust will soon arrive, Father Taylor shallhave an opportunity to make music with my soul
 But I forewarn thee,sweetest Dove, that thy husband is a most unmalleable man;--thou artnot to suppose, because his spirit answers to every touch of thine,that therefore every breeze, or even every whirlwind, can upturn himfrom his depths
 Well, dearest, I have said my say, on this matter
What a rain is this, my poor little Dove! Yet as the wind comes fromsome other quarter than the East, I trust that thou hast found itgenial
 Good bye, belovedest, till tomorrow evening
 Meantime, loveme, and dream of me
March 31st
--Evening
--Best Wife, it is scarcely dark yet; but thyhusband has just lighted his lamps, and sits down to talk to thee
Would that he could hear an answer in thine own sweet voice; for hisspirit needs to be cheered by that dearest of all harmonies, after along, listless, weary day
 Just at this moment, it does seem as iflife could not go on without it
 What is to be done?Dearest, if Elizabeth Howe is to be with you on Saturday, it would bequite a calamity to thee and thy household, for me to come at the sametime
 Now will Sophie Hawthorne complain, and the Dove's eyes besuffused, at my supposing that their husband's visit could be acalamity at any time
 Well, at least, we should be obliged to give upmany hours of happiness, and it would not even be certain that I couldhave the privilege of seeing mine own wife in private, at all
Wherefore, considering these things, I have resolved, and do herebymake it a decree of fate, that my present widowhood shall continue oneweek longer
 And my sweetest Dove--yes, and naughtiest SophieHawthorne too--will both concur in the fitness of this resolution, andwill help me to execute it with what of resignation is attainable bymortal man, by writing me a letter full of strength and comfort
 AndI, infinitely dear wife, will write to thee again; so that, though myearthly part will not be with thee on Saturday, yet thou shalt have myheart and soul in a letter
 Will not this be right, and for the best?"Yes, dearest husband," saith my meekest little Dove; and SophieHawthorne cannot gainsay her
Mine unspeakably ownest, dost thou love me a million of times as muchas thou didst a week ago? As for me, my heart grows deeper and widerevery moment, and still thou fillest it in all its depths andboundlessness
 Wilt thou never be satisfied with making me love thee?what use canst thou put so much love as thou continually receivestfrom me? Dost thou hoard it up, as misers do their treasure?     THINE OWN BLESSEDEST HUSBAND
April 1st
 Before breakfast
--Good morning, entirely belovedest
Sophie Hawthorne, I have enclosed something for thee in this letter
If thou findest it not, then tell me what thou art
     Blessedest wife, thy husband has been busy all day, from earlybreakfast-time to late in the afternoon; and old Father Time has goneonward somewhat less heavily, than is his wont when I am imprisonedwithin the walls of the Custom-House
 It has been a brisk, breezy day,as thou knowest--an effervescent atmosphere; and I have enjoyed it inall its freshness, breathing air which had not been breathed inadvance by the hundred thousand pairs of lungs which have common andindivisible property in the atmosphere of this great city
--My breathhad never belonged to anybody but me
 It came fresh from thewilderness of ocean
 My Dove ought to have shared it with me, and sohave made it infinitely sweeter--save her, I would wish to have anatmosphere all to myself
 And, dearest, it was exhilarating to see thevessels, how they bounded over the waves, while a sheet of foam brokeout around them
 I found a good deal of enjoyment, too, in the busyscene around me; for several vessels were disgorging themselves (whatan unseemly figure is this--"disgorge," quotha, as if the vessels weresick at their stomachs) on the wharf; and everybody seemed to beworking with might and main
 It pleased thy husband to think that healso had a part to act in the material and tangible business of thislife, and that a part of all this industry could not have gone onwithout his presence
 Nevertheless, my belovedest, pride not thyselftoo much on thy husband's activity and utilitarianism; he is naturallyan idler, and doubtless will soon be pestering thee with bewailmentsat being compelled to earn his bread by taking some little share inthe toils of mortal man
Most beloved, when I went to the Custom-House, at one o'clock, ColonelHall held up a letter, turning the seal towards me; and he seemed tobe quite as well aware as myself, that the long-legged little fowlimpressed thereon was a messenger from my Dove
 And so, naughtiest,thou art not patient
 Well; it will do no good to scold thee
 I knowSophie Hawthorne of old--yea, of very old time do I know her; orrather, of very old eternity
 There was an image of such a being, deepwithin my soul, before we met in this dim world; and thereforenothing that she does, or says, or thinks, or feels, ever surprisesme
 Her naughtiness is as familiar to me as if it were my own
 Butdearest, do be patient; because thou seest that the busy days arecoming again; and how is thy husband to bear his toil lightsomely, ifhe knows that thou art impatient and disquieted
 By and bye, as soonas God will open a way to us, we will help one another bear theburthen of the day, whatever it may be
My little Dove, the excellent Colonel Hall, conceiving, I suppose,that our correspondence must necessarily involve a great expenditureof paper, has imparted to thy husband a quire or two of superfinegilt-edged, which he brought from Congress
 The sheet on which I amnow writing is a specimen; and he charged me to give thee a portion ofit, which I promised to do--but whether I shall convey it to thee inthe mass, or sheet by sheet, after spoiling it with my uncouthscribble, is yet undetermined
 Which wouldst thou prefer? Likewisethree sticks of sealing-[wax] did the good Colonel bestow; butunfortunately it is all red
 Yet I think it proper enough that agentleman should seal all his letters with red sealing-wax; though itis sweet and graceful in my Dove to use fancy-colored
 Dearest, thepaper thou shalt have, every sheet of it, sooner or later; and onlythat it is so burthensome to thy foolish husband to carry anything inhis hand, I would bring it to thee
 Meantime, till I hit upon someother method, I will send it sheet by sheet
     How long it is, belovedest, since I have written thee a letter fromthis darksome region
 Never did I write thee a word from hence thatwas worth reading, nor shall I now; but perhaps thou wouldst get noword at all, these two or three days, unless I write it here
 Thisevening, dearest, I am to have a visitor--the illustrious Colonel Hallhimself; and I have even promised him a bed on my parlor floor--sothat, as thou seest, the duties of hospitality will keep me fromcommunion with the best little wife in the world
Hearts never do understand the mystery of separation--that is thebusiness of the head
 My sweetest, dearest, purest, holiest, noblest,faithfullest wife, dost thou know what a loving husband thou hast?Dost thou love him most immensely?--beyond conception, and dost thoufeel, as he does, that every new throb of love is worth all otherhappiness in the world?Dearest, my soul drank thy letter this forenoon, and has beenconscious of it ever since, in the midst of business and noise and allsorts of wearisome babble
 How dreamlike it makes all my externallife, this continual thought and deepest, inmostest musing upon thee!I live only within myself; for thou art always there
 Thou makest me adisembodied spirit; and with the eve of a spirit, I look on allworldly things--and this it [is] that separates thy husband from thosewho seem to be his fellows--therefore is he "among them, but not ofthem
" Thou art transfused into his heart, and spread all round aboutit; and it is only once in a while that he himself is even imperfectlyconscious of what a miracle has been wrought upon him
Well, dearest, were ever such words as these written in a Custom-Housebefore? Oh, and what a mighty heave my heart has given, this verymoment! Thou art most assuredly thinking of me now, wife of my inmostbosom
 Never did I know what love was before--I did not even know itwhen I began this letter
 Ah, but I ought not to say that; it wouldmake me sad to believe that I had not always loved thee
 Farewell,now, dearest
 Be quiet, my Dove; lest my heart be made to flutter bythe fluttering of thy wings
April 7th
 6 P
M
 My tenderest Dove, hast thou lived through the polarwinter of to-day; for it does appear to me to have been the mostuncomfortable day that ever was inflicted on poor mortals
 Thy husbandhas had to face it in all its terrors; and the cold has penetratedthrough his cloak, through his beaver-cloth coat and vest, and wasneutralised nowhere but in the region round about his heart--and thatit did not chill him even there, he owes to thee
 I know not whether Ishould not have jumped overboard in despair today, if I had notsustained my spirit by the thought of thee, most beloved wife; for,besides the bleak, unkindly air, I have been plagued by two sets ofcoal-shovellers at the same time, and have had to keep two separatetallies simultaneously
 But, dearest, I was conscious that all thiswas merely a vision and a phantasy, and that, in reality, I was nothalf-frozen by the bitter blast, nor plagued to death by those grimycoal-heavers, but that I was basking quietly in the sunshine ofeternity, with mine own Dove
 Any sort of bodily and earthly tormentmay serve to make us sensible that we have a soul that is not withinthe jurisdiction of such shadowy demons--it separates the immortalwithin us from the mortal
 But the wind has blown my brain into suchconfusion that I cannot philosophise now
Blessingest wife, what a habit I have contracted of late, of tellingthee all my grievances and annoyances, as if such trifles were worthtelling--or as if, supposing them to be so, they would be the mostagreeable gossip in the world to thee
 Thou makest me behave like achild, naughtiest
 Why dost thou not frown at my nonsensicalcomplaints, and utterly refuse thy sympathy? But I speak to thee ofthe miseries of a cold day, and blustering wind, and intractablecoal-shovellers, with just the same certainty that thou wilt listenlovingly and sympathisingly, as if I were speaking of the momentousand permanent concerns of life
Dearest, 


 (portion of letter missing)I do not think that I can come on Friday--there is hardly anylikelihood of it; for one of the Measurers is indisposed, which throwsadditional work on the efficient members of our honorable body
 Butthere is no expressing how I do yearn for thee! The strength of thefeeling seems to make my words cold and tame
 Dearest, this is but apoor epistle, yet is written in very great love and worship ofthee--so, for the writer's sake, thou wilt receive it into thy heartof hearts
 God keep thee--and me also for thy sake
     THINE OWNEST
          Belovedest--since writing this word, I have made a considerable pause;for, dearest, my mind has no activity to-day
 I would fain sit still,and let thoughts, feelings, and images of thee, pass before me andthrough me, without my putting them into words, or taking any othertrouble about the matter
 It must be that thou dost not especially andexceedingly need a letter from me; else I should feel an impulse andnecessity to write
 I do wish, most beloved wife, that there were someother method of communing with thee at a distance; for really this isnot a natural one to thy husband
 In truth, I never use words, eitherwith the tongue or pen, when I can possibly express myself in anyother way;--and how much, dearest, may be expressed without theutterance of a word! Is there not a volume in many of ourglances?--even in a pressure of the hand? And when I write to thee,I do but painfully endeavor to shadow into words what has already beenexpressed in those realities
 In heaven, I am very sure, there will beno occasion for words;--our minds will enter into each other, andsilently possess themselves of their natural riches
 Even in thisworld, I think, such a process is not altogether impossible--weourselves have experienced it--but words come like an earthy wallbetwixt us
 Then our minds are compelled to stand apart, and makesignals of our meaning, instead of rushing into one another, andholding converse in an infinite and eternal language
 Oh, dearest,have [not] the moments of our oneness been those in which we were mostsilent? It is our instinct to be silent then, because words could notadequately express the perfect concord of our hearts, and thereforewould infringe upon it
 Well, ownest, good bye till tomorrow, whenperhaps thy husband will feel a necessity to use even such a wretchedmedium as words, to tell thee how he loves thee
 No words can tell itnow
April 15th
 Afternoon
--Most dear wife, never was thy husband gladderto receive a letter from thee than to-day
 And so thou didst perceivethat I was rather out of spirits on Monday
 Foolish and faithlesshusband that I was, I supposed that thou wouldst not take any noticeof it; but the simple fact was, that I did not feel quite so well asusual; and said nothing about it to thee, because I knew thou wouldstdesire me to put off my departure, which (for such a trifle) I felt itnot right to do--and likewise, because my Dove would have beennaughty, and so perhaps have made herself ten times as ill as herhusband
 Dearest, I am quite well now--only very hungry; for I havethought fit to eat very little for two days past; and I thinkstarvation is a remedy for almost all physical evils
 You will loveColonel Hall, when I tell you that he has not let me do a 


 (fewwords missing) 


 and even to-day he has sent me home to my room,although I assured him that I was perfectly able to work
 Now,dearest, it thou givest thyself any trouble and torment about thispast indisposition of mine, I shall never dare to tell thee about myfuture incommodities; but if I were sure thou wouldst estimate them atno more than they are worth, thou shouldst know them all, even to theslightest prick of my finger
 It is my impulse to complain to thee inall griefs, great and small; and I will not check that impulse, ifthou wilt sympathise reasonably, as well as most lovingly
 And now,ownest wife, believe that thy husband is well;--better, I fear, thanthou, who art tired to death, and hast even had the headache
Naughtiest, dost thou think that all the busts in the world, and allthe medallions and other forms of sculpture, would be worth creatingat the expence of such weariness and headaches to thee
 I would ratherthat thy art should be annihilated, than that thou shouldst always paythis price for its exercise
 But perhaps, when thou hast my bosom torepose upon, thou wilt no longer feel such overwhelming weariness
 Iam given thee to repose upon, that so my most tender and sensitivestlittle Dove may be able to do great works
And dearest, I do by no means undervalue thy works, though I cannotestimate all thou hast ever done at the price of a single throb ofanguish to thy belovedest head
 But thou has achieved mighty things
Thou hast called up a face which was hidden in the grave--hastre-created it, after it was resolved to dust--and so hast snatchedfrom Death his victory
 I wonder at thee, my beloved
 Thou art amiracle thyself, and workest miracles
 I would not have believed itpossible to do what thou hast done--to restore the lineaments of thedead so perfectly that even she who loved him so well can requirenothing more;--and this too, when thou hadst hardly known his livingface
 Thou couldst not have done it, unless God had helped thee
 Thissurely was inspiration, and of the holiest kind, and for one of theholiest purposes
Dearest, I shall long to see thee exceedingly next Saturday; buthaving been absent from duty for two or three days past it will not beright for me to ask any more time so soon
 Dost thou think it would?How naughty was thy husband to waste the first page of this letter indeclaiming against the blessed art of writing! I do not see how Icould live without it;--thy letters are my heart's food; andoftentimes my heart absolutely insists upon pouring itself out onpaper, for thy perusal
 In truth, if the heart would do all the work,I should probably write to thee the whole time of my absence; but thouknowest that the co-operation of the hand and head are indispensable;and they, not being able to comprehend the infinite necessity of theheart's finding utterance, are sometimes sluggish
April 17th
--Before breakfast
--Ownest, I am perfectly well thismorning
 Dost thou love me? Dearest, expect not another letter tillTuesday
 Is thy weariness quite gone?     THINE OWNEST, OWNEST HUSBAND
          , April 19th, 1840
--Forenoon
Dearest, there came no letter from thee yesterday; and I have been alittle disquieted with fears that thou art not well and art naughtyenough to conceal it from thy husband
 But this is a misdemeanor ofwhich my Dove ought not to be lightly suspected
 Or perhaps, ownestwife, thou didst imagine that I might mean to surprise thee by avisit, last evening, and therefore, instead of writing, didst hope tocommune with me in living words
 Best belovedest, if I could havecome, I would have given thee notice beforehand; for I love notsurprises, even joyful ones--or at least, I would rather that joyshould come quietly, and as a matter of course, and warning us of itsapproach by casting a placid gleam before it
 Mine own wife, art thouvery well? Thy husband is so, only love-sick--a disease only to becured by the pressure of a certain heart to his own heart
Belovedest, what a beautiful day was yesterday
 Wert thou abroad inthe sky and air? Thy husband's spirit did rebel against being confinedin his darksome dungeon, at the Custom-House; it seemed a sin--amurder of the joyful young day--a quenching of the sunshine
Nevertheless, there he was kept a prisoner,--till it was too late tofling himself on a gentle wind and be blown away into the country
 Iforesee, dearest, that thou wilt, now that the pleasant days of Mayand June are coming, be tormented quite beyond thine infinitepatience, with my groans and lamentations at being compelled to loseso much of life's scanty summertime
 But thou must enjoy for both ofus
 Thou must listen to the notes of the birds, because the rumblingof wheels will be always in my ears--thou must fill thyself with thefragrance of wild flowers, because I must breathe in the dust of thecity--thy spirit must enjoy a double share of freedom, because thyhusband is doomed to be a captive
 It is thine office now, most sweetwife, to make all the additions that may be made to our common stockof enjoyment
 By and bye, there shall not be so heavy burthen imposedupon thee
 When I shall be again free, I will enjoy all things withthe fresh simplicity of a child of five years old; thou shalt findthine husband grown young again, made over all anew--he will goforth and stand in a summer shower, and all the worldly dust that hascollected on him shall be washed away at once
 Then, dearest, wheneverthou art aweary, thou shalt lie down upon his heart as upon a bank offresh flowers
Nearly 6--P
M
 Thy husband went out to walk, dearest, about an hourago, and found it very pleasant, though there was a somewhat coolwind
 I went round and across the common, and stood on the highestpoint of it, whence I could see miles and miles into the country
Blessed be God for this green tract, and the view which it affords;whereby we poor citizens may be put in mind, sometimes, that all God'searth is not composed of brick blocks of houses, and of stone orwooden pavements
 Blessed be God for the sky too; though the smoke ofthe city may somewhat change its aspect--but still it is better thanif each street were covered over with a roof
 There were a good manypeople walking on the mall, mechanicks apparently and shopkeepers'clerks, with their wives and sweethearts; and boys were rolling on thegrass--and thy husband would have liked to lie down and roll too
Wouldst thou not have been ashamed of him? And, Oh, dearest, thoushouldst have been there, to help me to enjoy the green grass, and thefar-off hills and fields--to teach me how to enjoy them, for when Iview Nature without thee, I feel that I lack a sense
 When we aretogether, thy whole mind and fancy, as well as thy whole heart, ismine; so that all thy impressions from earth, sea, and sky, are addedto all mine
 How necessary hast thou made thyself to thy husband, mylittle Dove! When he is weary and out of spirits, his heart yearnethfor thee; and when he is among pleasant scenes, he requireth thee somuch the more
My dearest, why didst thou not write to me, yesterday? It were alwaysadvisable, methinks, to arrange matters so that a letter may be senton each Saturday, when I am not coming home; because Sunday leaves mefree to muse upon thee, and to imagine the state and circumstances inwhich thou art--and the present Sunday I have been troubled withfancies that thou art ill of body or ill at ease in mind
 Do not thouhave any such foolish fancies about me, mine ownest
 Oh, how we find,at every moment of our lives, that we ought always to be together!Then there would be none of these needless heartquakes; but now howcan they be avoided, when we mutually feel that one-half our being iswandering away by itself, without the guidance and guard of the otherhalf! Well; it will not be always so
 Doubtless, God has planned howto make us happy; but thy husband, being of a rebellious anddistrustful nature, cannot help wishing sometimes that our Fatherwould let him into His plans
I do trust, my dearest, that thou hast been enjoying this bright dayfor both of us; for thy husband has spent it in his dungeon--and theonly ray of light that broke upon him, was when he opened thy letter
Belovedest, I have folded it to my heart, and ever and anon it sends athrill through me; for thou hast steeped it with thy love--it seems asif thy head were leaning against my breast
 I long to get home, that Imay read it again and again; for in this uncongenial region, I can buthalf comprehend it--at least, I feel that there is a richness andsweetness in it, too sacred to be enjoyed, save in privacy
 Dearestwife, thy poor husband is sometimes driven to wish that thou and hecould mount upon a cloud (as we used to fancy in those heavenly walksof ours) and be borne quite out of sight and hearing of all theworld;--then, at last, our souls might melt into each other; but now,all the people in the world seem to come between us
 How happy wereAdam and Eve! There was no third person to come between them, and allthe infinity around them only served to press their hearts closertogether
 We love [one] another as well as they: but there is nosilent and lovely garden of Eden for us
 Mine own, wilt thou sail awaywith me to discover some summer island?--dost thou not think that Godhas reserved one for us, ever since the beginning of the world? Ah,foolish husband that I am, to raise a question of it, when we havefound such an Eden, such an island sacred to us two, whenever, whetherin Mrs
 Quincy's boudoir, or anywhere else, we have been clasped inone another's arms! That holy circle shuts out all the world--then weare the Adam and Eve of a virgin earth
 Now good-bye dearest; forvoices are babbling around me, and I should not wonder if thou wertto hear the echo of them, while thou readest this letter
April 22d--6 o'clock P
M
 To-day, dearest, I have been measuring salt,on Long-Wharf; and though considerably weary, I feel better satisfiedthan if I had been murdering the blessed day at the Custom-House
 Mineown wife, how very good wast thou, to take me with thee on that sweetwalk, last Monday! And how kind-hearted was that sensible old stump!Thou enquirest whether I ever heard a stump speak before
 No, indeed;but "stump-speeches" (as thou mayst learn in the newspapers) are verycommon in the western country
 Belovedest, I have met with an immensemisfortune
 Dost thou sympathise from the bottom of thy heart? Wouldstthou take it upon thyself, if possible? Yea; I know thou wouldst, evenwithout asking the nature of it; and truth to tell, I could be selfishenough to wish that thou mightest share it with me
 Now art thou allin a fever of anxiety! I feel the fluttering of thy foolish littleheart
 Shall I tell thee? No
--Yes; I will
 I have received aninvitation to a party at General McNeil's, next Friday evening
 Whywill not people let your poor persecuted husband alone? What possiblegood can it do for me to thrust my coal-begrimed visage andsalt-befrosted locks into good society? What claim have I to bethere--a humble Measurer, a subordinate Custom-House officer, as I am!I cannot go
 I will not go
 I intend to pass that evening with mywife--that is to say, in musings and dreams of her, and moreover, itwas an exceeding breach of etiquette, that this belovedest wife wasnot included in the invitation
My duties began at sunrise, after a somewhat scanty night's rest;for George Hillard and his brother, from London, came to see me, whenI was preparing to go [to] bed; and I was kept up pretty late
 But Icame home at about four o'clock, and straightway went to bed! What asinful way was that of misusing this summer afternoon! I trust, mostdear wife, that the better half of my being has drawn from the sweetday all the honey that it contained
 I feel as if it were not so muchmatter, now, whether my days pass pleasantly or irksomely, since thoucanst be living a golden life for both of us
 Sometime or other, wewill contribute each an equal share of enjoyment
Dearest, thou knowest not how I have yearned for thee
 And now thereis but one day more of widowhood! Sophie Hawthorne must not expect meany more on Fridays, till the busy season is over
 If I can alwayscome on the appointed Saturday, it will be a great mercy of Heaven;but I trust in Heaven's goodness, and the instrumentality of ColonelHall
 Now God bless thee, ownest wife
 God bless us
     I did not reach home last night till candle-light, and then I wasbeyond expression weary and spiritless; and I could as soon haveclimbed into Heaven without a ladder, as to come to see thee at Mrs
Park's
 So, instead of dressing to pay a visit, I undressed and wentto bed; but yet I doubt whether I ought not to have gone, for I wasrestless and wakeful a great part of the night; and it seemed as if Ihad scarcely fallen asleep, when I awoke with a start, and saw thegray dawn creeping over the roofs of the houses
 So then it wasnecessary for thy poor husband to leave his pillow, without enjoyingthat half-dreaming interval which I so delight to devote to thee
However the fresh morning air made a new creature of me; and all day Ihave felt tolerably lively and cheerful--as much so as is anywiseconsistent with this intolerable position of near distance, ordistant nearness, in which we now find ourselves
 Truly Providencedoes not seem to have smiled on this visit of thine, my dearest
 Thedispensation is somewhat hard to bear
 There is a weight and a gnawingat my heart; but, belovedest, do let thy heart be cheerful, for thyhusband's sake
Very reviving to me was thy letter, mine ownest
 Colonel Hall broughtit at noon to the eating-house where we had agreed to dine together;and I forthwith opened it and read it while my beefsteak was broiling
It refreshed me much more than my dinner--which is a great deal for ahungry man to say
 Dearest, I am in admirable health; it is not thenature of my present mode of life to make me sick; and my nightlyweariness does not betoken anything of that kind
 Each day, it istrue, exhausts all the life and animation that there is in me; buteach night restores as much as will be required for the expenditure ofthe next day
 I think this week has been about as tough as any that Iever experienced
 I feel the burthen of such constant occupation themore sensibly, from having had so many idle intervals of late
Oh, dearest, do not thou tire thyself to death
 Whenever thou feelestweary, then oughtest thou to glide away from all the world; and go tosleep with the thought of thy husband in thy heart
 Why do notpeople know better what is requisite for a Dove, than thus to keep herwings fluttering all day long, never allowing her a moment to foldthem in peace and quietness? I am anxious for thee, mine ownest wife
When I have the sole charge of thee, these things shall not be
Belovedest, didst thou not bless this shower? It caused thy husband'slabors to cease for the day, though it confined him in the cabin ofthe salt-ship till it was over; but when the drops came few and farbetween, I journeyed hither to our parlor, and began this scribble
Really I did not think my ideas would be alert enough to write half somuch; but I have scrawled one line after another; and now I feel muchrevived, and soothed and cheered in mind
 I shall sleep the morequietly, sweetest wife, for having had this talk with thee--thou wiltbless my sleep
 I wish that thou couldst receive this letter to-night,because I am sure thou needest it
Let me know, mine ownest, what time thou intendest to go to Salem; andif it be possible, I will come to the Depot to see thee
 But do notexpect me too fervently, because there are many chances that it willnot be in my power
 What a time this has been for my Dove and me!Never, since we were married, have the fates been so perverse
 Andnow farewell, my dearest, dearest wife, on whom I repose, in whom I amblest--whom I love with all the heart that is in me, and will lovemore and more forever, as I grow more worthy to love thee
 Be happy,dearest; for my happiness must come through thee
God bless thee, and let me feel his blessing through thy heart
Where in the world art thou?--or hast thou flown away to Paradise,naughtiest Dove, without bidding thy husband farewell? I know notwhereabout this letter will find thee; but I throw it upon the windsin the confidence that some breeze of Heaven will bear it to thee; forI suppose heart never spoke to heart, without being heard, and sooneror later finding a response
 Perhaps some hearts that speak to otherhearts here on earth may find no response till they have passed farinto Eternity; but our hearts catch each other's whispers even here
Happy we! But, belovedest, how is it that thou hast sent me no tokenof thy existence, since we parted on the Hoopers' doorstep, when thoudidst press my hand without a word? It seems an age since then
 Thousaidst, on Sunday, that thou shouldst probably return to Salem to-day;but surely thou hast not gone
 I feel lonely and not cheerful--myspirit knows not whereabout to seek thee, and so it shivers as ifthere were no Thou at all--as if my Dove had been only a dream and avision, and now had vanished into unreality and nothingness
But tomorrow I shall surely hear from thee: and even should it beotherwise, I shall yet know, with everlasting faith, that my Dove'sheart has been trying to make me sensible of its embraces all thistime
 My dearest, was not that a sweet time--that Sabbath afternoonand eve? But why didst thou look up in my face, as we walked, and askwhy I was so grave? If I was grave I know no cause for it, beloved
Lights and shadows are continually flitting across my inward sky, andI know neither whence they come nor whither they go; nor do I inquiretoo closely into them
 It is dangerous to look too minutely at suchphenomena
 It is apt to create a substance, where at first there was amere shadow
 If at any time, dearest wife, there should seem--thoughto me there never does--but if there should ever seem to be anexpression unintelligible from one of our souls to another, we willnot strive to interpret it into earthly language, but wait for thesoul to make itself understood; and were we to wait a thousand years,we need deem it no more time than we can spare
 I speak only inreference to such dim and intangible matters as that which suggestedthis passage of my letter
 It is not that I have any love for mystery;but because I abhor it--and because I have felt, a thousand times,that words may be a thick and darksome veil of mystery between thesoul and the truth which it seeks
 Wretched were we, indeed, if we hadno better means of communicating ourselves, no fairer garb in which toarray our essential selves, than these poor rags and tatters of Babel
Yet words are not without their use, even for purposes ofexplanation,--but merely for explaining outward acts, and all sorts ofexternal things, leaving the soul's life and action to explain itselfin its own way
My belovedest, what a misty disquisition have I scribbled! I would notread it over for sixpence
 Think not that I supposed it necessary tosermonize thee so; but the sermon created itself from sentence tosentence; and being written, thou knowest that it belongs to thee, andI have no right to keep it back
 Dearest, I was up very early thismorning, and have had a good deal to do, especially this afternoon
Let me plead this excuse for my dulness and mistiness
 I suspect that,hereafter, my little Dove will know how to estimate the difficulty ofpouring one's self out in a soul-written letter, amid thedistractions of business and society--she herself having experiencedthese checks upon her outpourings
Now good bye, mine ownest wife
 God bless us both--or may God blesseither of us, and that one will bless the other
 Dost thou sleep wellnow-a-nights, belovedest? Of whom dost thou dream? Thy husband's longdays and short nights hardly leave him time to dream
     THINE OWNEST
Dearest, just as I was folding this letter, came thy note
 Do thou beat the Depot as soon as possible after eleven; and I will move Heavenand earth to meet thee there
 Perhaps a little before eleven
Rejoice with thy husband, for he is free from a load of coal, whichhas been pressing upon his shoulders throughout all this hot weather
I am convinced that Christian's burthen consisted of coal; and nowonder he felt so much relieved when it fell off and rolled into thesepulchre
 His load, however, at the utmost, could not have been morethan a few bushels; whereas mine was exactly one hundred andthirty-five chaldrons and seven tubs



 Oh, my dearest, I feel thestroke upon mine own head
 Except through thee, I can never feel anytorment of that nature; for all these burning suns have blazed upon myhead, unprotected except by a black hat, and yet I have felt no moreinconvenience than if I had been sitting in the pleasant gloom of adewy grot
 Belovedest, be a great deal more careful of thyself
Remember always that thou art not thine own, but that Providence hasentrusted to thy keeping a most delicate physical frame, which belongswholly to me, and which therefore thou must keep with infinitely morecare than thou wouldst the most precious jewel
 And yet, I would nothave thee anxious and watchful like an invalid; but thou shouldstconsider that thou wert created to dwell nowhere but in the clime ofParadise, and wast only placed upon this earth, because thy husband ishere and cannot do without thee--and that east-winds and fierce sunsare evil unknown in thy native region, and therefore thy frame was notso constructed as to resist them; wherefore thine own wise precautionsmust be thy safeguard
 Blessedest, I kiss thy brow,--at least, I kissthe air thrice; and if none of the three kisses reach thee, then threevery precious things will have gone forth from my heart in vain
 Butif any of thy headache and bewilderment have remained hitherto, andnow thou feelest somewhat like a breath of Heaven on thy brow, we willtake it for granted that my kisses have found thee out
 Good bye now,dearest wife; for I am weary and stupid; and as I need not be at theCustom-House before eight or nine o'clock tomorrow, thou shalt havethe rest of the letter freshly written in the morning
Now it will be lucky for thee if thou gettest the last page of thisletter entirely full
 Dearest, thy last letter had the fragrance of abank of violets--yea, all sorts of sweet smelling flowers and perfumedshrubs
 I can lie down and repose upon it, as upon a bed of roses
 Itrejoices me to think that my whole being is not enveloped withcoal-dust, but that its better half is breathing the breath offlowers
 Oh, do be very happy, mine ownest wife, and fill thyself withall gentle pleasures that lie within thy reach; because at presentthou hast a double duty to perform in this respect; since, so far asmy enjoyments depend on external things, I can contribute nothing tothe common stock of happiness
 And yet dearest, nothing that I everenjoyed before can come into the remotest comparison with my continualenjoyment of thy love--with the deep, satisfied repose which thatconsciousness brings to me; a repose subsisting, and ever to subsist,in the midst of all anxieties, troubles and agitations
Belovedest, I sometimes wish that thou couldst be with [me] on boardmy salt-vessels and colliers; because there are many things of whichthou mightst make such pretty descriptions; and in future years, whenthy husband is again busy at the loom of fiction, he would weave inthese little pictures
 My fancy is rendered so torpid by my ungenialway of life, that I cannot sketch off the scenes and portraits thatinterest me; and I am forced to trust them to my memory, with the hopeof recalling them at some more favorable period
 For three or fourdays past, I have been observing a little Mediterranean boy, fromMalaga, not more than ten or eleven years old, but who is already acitizen of the world, and seems to be just as gay and contented on thedeck of a Yankee coal-vessel, as he could be while playing beside hismother's door
 It is really touching to see how free and happy heis--how the little fellow takes this whole wide world for his home,and all mankind for his family
 He talks Spanish--at least, that ishis native tongue; but he is also very intelligible in English, andperhaps he likewise has smatterings of the speech of other countries,whither the winds may have wafted this little sea-bird
 He is aCatholic; and yesterday, being Friday, he caught some fish and friedthem for his dinner, in sweet oil; and really they looked so delicatethat I almost wished he would invite me to partake
 Every once in awhile, he undresses himself and leaps overboard, plunging down beneaththe waves, as if the sea were as native to him as the earth; then heruns up the rigging of the vessel, as if he meant to fly away throughthe air
 Do thou remember this little boy, dearest, and tell me ofhim one of these days; and perhaps I may make something more beautifulof him than thou wouldst think from these rough and imperfect touches
Belovedest, is thy head quite well? Art thou very beautiful now? Dostthou love me infinitely?Thy Friday's letter came in due season to the Custom-House; butColonel Hall could not find time to bring it to the remote region ofthe earth, where I was then an exile; so that it awaited me till thenext morning
 At noon, came thy next letter, at an interval of severalhours from the receipt of the former--a space quite long enough to beinterposed between thy missives
 And yesterday arrived thy letter ofthe Sabbath--and all three are very precious to thy husband; and theoftener they come the more he needs them
 Now I must go down tobreakfast
 Dost thou not wonder at finding me scribbling between sevenand eight o'clock in the morning? I do believe, naughtiest, that thouhast been praying for the non-arrival of salt and coal--notconsidering that, if thy petitions are heard, the poor Measurers willnot earn a sixpence
Belovedest, I know not what counsel to give thee about calling on mysisters; and therefore must leave the matter to thine own exquisitesense of what is right and delicate
 We will talk it over at an earlyopportunity
 I think I can partly understand why they appear cooltowards thee; but it is for nothing in thyself personally, nor for anyunkindness towards my Dove, whom everybody must feel to be theloveablest being in the world
 But there are some untowardcircumstances
 Nevertheless, I have faith that all will be well, andthat they will receive Sophie Hawthorne and the Dove into their heartof hearts; so let us wait patiently on Providence, as we always have,and see what time will bring forth
 And, my dearest, whenever thoufeelest disquieted about things of this sort--if ever that be thecase--do thou speak freely to thy husband; for these are matters inwhich words may be of use, because they concern the relations betweenourselves and others
 Now, good bye, belovedest, till night
 Iperceive that the sun is shining dimly; but I fear that there is stillan east wind to keep my Dove in her dove-cote
Towards night--Ownest wife, the day has been spent without muchpleasure or profit--a part of the time at the Custom-House, waitingthere for the chance of work,--partly at the Athenaeum, and partlyat a bookstore, looking for something suitable for our library
 Amongother recent purchases, I have bought a very good edition of Milton(his poetry) in two octavo volumes; and I saw a huge new London volumeof his prose works, but it seemed to me that there was but a smallportion of it that thou and I should ever care about reading--so Ileft it on the shelf
 Dearest, I have bought some lithographic printsat auction, which I mean to send thee, that thou mayst show them tothy husband, the next afternoon that thou permittest him to spend withthee
 Thou art not to expect anything very splendid; for I did notenter the auction-room till a large part of the collection was sold;so that my choice was limited
 Perhaps there are one or two notaltogether unworthy to be put on the walls of our sanctuary; but thisI leave to thy finer judgment
 I would thou couldst peep into my roomand see thine own pictures, from which I have removed the black veils;and there is no telling how much brighter and cheerfuller the parlorlooks now, whenever I enter it
Belovedest, I love thee very especially much today
 But then thatnaughty Sophie Hawthorne--it would be out of the question to treat herwith tenderness
 Nothing shall she get from me, at my next visit,save a kiss upon her nose; and I should not wonder it she were toreturn the favor with a buffet upon my ear
 Mine own Dove, how unhappyart thou to be linked with such a mate!--to be bound up in the samevolume with her!--and me unhappy, too, to be forced to keep such aturbulent little rebel in my inmost heart! Dost thou not think shemight be persuaded to withdraw herself, quietly, and take up herresidence somewhere else? Oh, what an idea! It makes my heart closeits valves and embrace her the more closely
Well, dearest, it is breakfast time, and thy husband hath an appetite
What dost thou eat for breakfast?--but I know well enough that thounever eatest anything but bread and milk and chickens
 Dost thou lovepigeons in a pie? I am fonder of Dove than anything else--it is myheart's food and sole sustenance
 God bless us
Thou hast strayed quite out of the sphere of my imagination, and Iknow not how to represent thy whereabout, any more than if thou hadstgone on pilgrimage beyond the sea, or to the moon
 Dost thou stilllove me, in all thy wanderings? Are there any east-winds there? Truly,now that thou hast escaped beyond its jurisdiction, I could wish thatthe east wind would blow every day, from ten o'clock till five; forthere is great refreshment in it for us poor mortals that toil beneaththe sun
 Dearest, thou must not think too unkindly even of theeast-wind
 It is not, perhaps, a wind to be loved, even in itsbenignest moods; but there are seasons when I delight to feel itsbreath upon my cheek, though it be never advisable to throw open mybosom and take it into my heart, as I would its gentle sisters of theSouth and West
 To-day, if I had been on the wharves, the slightchill of an east wind would have been a blessing, like the chill ofdeath to a world-weary man
 But, dearest, thou wilt rejoice to hearthat this has been one of the very idlest days that I ever spent in
 Oh, hadst thou been here! In the morning, soon afterbreakfast, I went to the Athenaeum Gallery; and during the hour or twothat I stayed, not a single visitor came in
 Some people were puttingup paintings in one division of the room; but we might have had theother all to ourselves--thy husband had it all to himself--or rather,he did not have it, nor possess it in fulness and reality, becausethou wast not there
 I cannot see pictures without thee; so thou mustnot expect me to criticise this exhibition
 There are two picturesthere by our friend (thy friend--and is it not the same thing?) SarahClark--scenes in Kentucky
 Doubtless I shall find them very admirable,when we have looked at them together
 The gallery of sculpture I shallnot visit, unless I can be there with thee
From the picture gallery I went to the reading-room of the Athenaeum,and there read the magazines till nearly twelve--thence to theCustom-House, and soon afterwards to dinner with Colonel Hall--thenback to the Custom-House, but only for a little while
 There wasnothing in the world to do, and so, at two o'clock, I came home andlay down on the bed, with the Faery Queen in my hand, and my Dove inmy heart
 Soon a pleasant slumber came over me; it was not a deep,sound sleep, but a slumbrous withdrawing of myself from the externalworld
 Whether thou camest to me in a dream, I cannot tell; but thoudidst peep at me through all the interstices of sleep
 After I awoke,I did not take up the Faery Queen again, but lay thinking of thee, andat last bestirred myself and got up to write this letter
 Mybelovedest wife, does it not make thee happy to think that thy husbandhas escaped, for one whole summer day, from his burthen of salt andcoal, and has been almost as idle as ever his idle nature coulddesire?--and this, too, on one of the longest days of all the year!Oh, could I have spent it in some shady nook, with mine own wife! Nowgood-bye, blessedest
 So indolent is thy husband, that he intends nowto relieve himself even from the sweet toil of shaping his thoughts ofthee into written words; moreover, there is no present need of it,because I am not to be at the Custom-House very early, and can finishthis letter tomorrow morning
 Good-bye, dearest, and keep a quietheart
June 12th
 ½ past 7 A
M
--Belovedest, art thou not going to be veryhappy to-day? I hope so, and believe so; and, dearest, if thou findestthyself comfortable at Concord--and if the Emersonians love thee andadmire thee as they ought--do not thou too stubbornly refuse to stay aweek longer than the term first assigned
(Remainder of letter missing)     , June 22d, (Monday) ½ past 4 [1840]Ownest, Colonel Hall put thy letter into my hand at our eating-house,so that its reception was timed very like that of mine to thee; butthy husband cared not for ceremony, nor for the presence of fiftypeople, but straightway broke the "long-legged little fowl" asunderand began to read
 Belovedest, what a letter! Never was so much beautypoured out of any heart before; and to read it over and over is likebathing my brow in a fresh fountain, and drinking draughts that renewthe life within me
 Nature is kind and motherly to thee, and takeththee into her inmost heart and cherisheth thee there, because thoulookest on her with holy and loving eyes
 My dearest, how canst thousay that I have ever written anything beautiful, being thyself sopotent to reproduce whatever is loveliest? If I did not know that thoulovest me, I should even be ashamed before thee
 Sweetest wife, itgladdens me likewise that thou meetest with such sympathy there, andthat thy friends have faith that thy husband is worthy of thee,because they see that thy wise heart could not have gone astray
Worthy of thee I am not; but thou wilt make me so; for there will betime, or eternity enough, for thy blessed influence to work upon me
Would that we could build our cottage this very now, this very summer,amid the scenes which thou describest
 My heart thirsts and languishesto be there, away from the hot sun and the coal-dust and the steamingdocks, and the thick-pated, stubborn, contentious men, with whom Ibrawl from morning till night, and all the weary toil which quiteengrosses me, and yet occupies only a part of my being which I did notknow existed before I became a Measurer
 I do think that I should sinkdown quite disheartened and inanimate if thou wert not happy, andgathering from earth and sky enjoyment for both of us; but this makesme feel that my real, innermost soul is apart from all these unlovelycircumstances,--and that it has not ceased to exist, as I mightsometimes suspect, but is nourished and kept alive through thee
Belovedest, if thou findest it good to be there, why wilt thou notstay even a little longer than this week? Thou knowest not whatcomfort I have in thinking of thee and those beautiful scenes; wherethe east wind cometh not, and amid those sympathizing hearts, whichperhaps thou wilt not find elsewhere--at least not everywhere
 I feelas if thou hadst found a haven of peace and rest, where I can trustthee without disquiet, and feel that thou art safe
 It thou art welland happy, if thy cheek is becoming rosier, if thy step is light andjoyous there, and if thy heart makes pleasant music, then is it notbetter for thee to stay a little longer? And if better for thee, it isso for thy husband likewise
 Now, ownest wife, I do not press thee tostay, but leave it all to thy wisdom, and if thou feelest that it isnow time to come home, most gladly will he welcome thee
Dearest, I meant to have written to thee yesterday afternoon, so thatthou shouldst have received the letter today, but Mrs
 Hillard pressedher husband and myself to take a walk into the country, because hishealth needed such an excursion
 So, after taking a nap, we set forthover the western avenue--a dreary, treeless, fierce-sunshiny, irksomeroad; but after journeying three or four or five miles, we came tosome of the loveliest rural scenery--yes, the very loveliest--thatever I saw in my life
 The first part of our road was like the life oftoil and weariness that I am now leading; the latter part was likethe life that we will lead hereafter
 Would that I had thy pen, and Iwould give thee pictures of beauty to match thine own; but I shouldonly mar my remembrance of them by the attempt
 Not a beautiful scenedid I behold but I imaged thee in the midst of it--thou wast with mein all the walk, and when I sighed it was for thee, and when I smiledit was for thee, and when I trusted in future happiness, it was forthee; and if I did not doubt and fear, it was altogether because ofthee
 What else than happiness can God intend for thee?--and if thyhappiness, then mine also
 On our return, we stopped at Braman'sbaths, and plunged in, and washed away all stains of earth, and becamenew creatures
 Dearest, I sympathize with thee in thy love of thebath, and conveniences for it must not be forgotten in our domesticarrangements
 Yet I am not entirely satisfied with any more contractedbath than the illimitable ocean; and to plunge into it is the nextthing to soaring into the sky
This morning I rose early to finish measuring a load of coal, whichbeing accomplished in the forenoon, and there being little prospect ofanything more to do, Colonel Hall, who perceived that thy husband'senergies were somewhat exhausted by the heat, and by much brawlingwith the coal-people, did send me home immediately after dinner
 Sothen I took a nap, with a volume of Spenser in my hand, and awaking atfour, I re-re-reperused thy last letter, and sat down to pour myselfout to thee, and in so doing, dearest wife, I have had great comfort
And now the afternoon is beautiful in its decline; but my feet aresomewhat afflicted with yesterday's excursion; so that I am in doubtwhether to go out again, although I should like a bath
Belovedest, I must not forget to thank Mr
 Emerson for his invitationto Concord; but really it will not be in my power to accept it
 Dothou say this in the way it ought to be said, and let him know what abusiness-machine thy husband is
 Now, good-bye
 Art thou very happy? Itrust so, dearest
 Thou hast our whole treasure of happiness in thykeeping
 Keep it safe, ownest wife, and add to it continually
 Godbless thee
Doubtless thou didst expect a letter from me yesterday; but my dayshave been so busy, and my evenings so invaded with visitants, that Ihave not had a moment's time to talk with thee
 Scarcely, till thismorning, have I been able to read thy letter quietly
 Night beforelast, came Mr
 Jones Very; and thou knowest that he is somewhatunconscionable as to the length of his calls
 Yesterday I came homeearly; and had the fates been propitious, thou shouldst have had along letter; but in the afternoon came Mr
 Hillard's London brother,and wasted my precious hours with a dull talk of nothing; and in theevening I was sorely tried with Mr
 Conolly, and a Cambridgelaw-student, who came to do homage to thy husband's literary renown
So my sweetest wife was put aside for these idle people
 I do wish theblockheads, and all other blockheads in this world, could comprehendhow inestimable are the quiet hours of a busy man--especially whenthat man has no native impulse to keep him busy, but is continuallyforced to battle with his own nature, which yearns for seclusion (thesolitude of a united two, my belovedest) and freedom to think, anddream, and feel
Well, dearest, thy husband is in perfect health this morning, and goodspirits; and much doth he rejoice that thou art so soon to be nearhim
 No tongue can tell--no pen can write what I feel
 Belovedest, donot thou make thyself sick in the bustle of removing; for I think thatthere is nothing more trying, even to a robust frame and ruggedspirit, than the disturbance of such an occasion
 Now, good-bye; for Imust hurry to the Custom-House to see Colonel Hall, who is going outof town for two days, and will probably leave the administration ofour department in my hands
God bless thee, belovedest;--and perhaps thou wilt receive anotherI have almost forgotten how to write letters--not having put pen topaper for that purpose (or any other, indeed) since my last to thee;but I cannot help writing thee a few lines, now when I had hoped to belistening to thy sweetest voice
 Art thou much changed in thisintervening time? Is thy hair grown gray? Art thou an old woman?Truly, it does appear very, very long to thy husband--an incomputableperiod
 Belovedest, I had been out this forenoon; and when I returned,there was thy letter, lying on the threshold of my chamber-door
 I hada presage of calamity, as soon as I saw it
 Had I known of this visitof thine aunt, I would have taken the opportunity to go to Salem, andso we would have had next Sunday to ourselves
 Does thine aunt saythat thou lookest in magnificent health?--and that thou art verybeautiful? If she has not yet said so thou shouldst ask her opinion onthat point
Belovedest, even if thine aunt Curtis should stay a week, do notthou incommode thy mother and sisters by trying to arrange a meeting
It is very painful to me to disturb and derange anybody in the world
Thou dost not say whether thou art very well to-day--and whether thouart light of heart
 I beseech thee never to write me even the shortestnote, without giving me a glimpse of thyself in the very moment ofwriting;--and yet, I leave it all to thee, and withdraw this lastpetition
 Thou knowest best what to write; for thou art an inspiredlittle penwoman
Thy husband is to measure salt at the end of Long Wharf tomorrow, andthe next day, and probably the next, and the next
 It is as desirablea place and employment as a Measurer can expect; so let thy visions ofme be rather pleasurable than otherwise
 I am in particularly goodhealth; but my heart hungers for thee--nevertheless, I mean to becheerful and content
 Do thou be so likewise, little Dove--and naughtySophie Hawthorne too
 Now, good-bye
 This is a very empty letter--atleast, it would be so, if it had not an infinite love in it
 God blessthee
I had a presentiment of a letter from thee this morning; and so wasnot at all surprised when I saw thy father in the long, low, darksomeroom where thy husband was in durance
 But I had not the leastanticipation of the intelligence which thou didst send me; and it isthe harder to be borne, because--(do not be naughty, ownest Dove)--Ihave an indispensable engagement at Cambridge tomorrow afternoon andevening; whereby our meeting must be delayed yet another day
 Dearest,do set me a lofty example of patience
 Be very good and very quiet,and enjoy thy Aunt Curtis's society to the utmost, and press her tostay with thee till Wednesday at six o'clock
 But not an hour longer!Thou must absolutely eject [her] with thine own tender little hands,if she propose to tarry that night also
Belovedest, I went to the Hurley Burley last evening; and consideringthat it was the first time I had been there without thee since wewere married, I enjoyed it very well
 We had a good deal of talk; butI missed thy gentle voice, which is surely the sweetest sound that wasever heard anywhere save in Paradise
 Thy husband talked somewhat morethan is his wont, but said nothing that is at all worth repeating; andI think he might as well have dispensed with saying anything
 He showshis wisdom and policy much more in his general silence than in hisoccasional loquacity
 Dearest, if I had not so high a respect for thyjudgment, I should pronounce thy husband but a tolerable person, atbest; but as thou hast been impelled to give thy precious self to sucha man, there must be more in him than ordinary eyes can perceive
 MissBurley proposed to me to write an address of some kind for theBunker-Hill fair; but I manifested no readiness to comply--neither doI feel any
 Has my Dove contributed anything?I went home in the midst of that beautiful rain, and sat up two hourswith Elizabeth and Louisa
This has not been a toilsome day, my wife
 Indeed, I have had nothingto do; nor is it certain that I shall be employed tomorrow morning
Quite unexpected is this lull amid the tempest of business
 I left theCustom-House at about four o'clock, and went to the bath, where Ispent half an hour very deliciously
 Dearest, we must have all sortsof bathing conveniences in our establishment
 Thou art a water-spirit,like Undine
 And thy spirit is to mine a pure fountain, in which Ibathe my brow and heart; and immediately all the fever of the worlddeparts
 Thou art--but I cannot quite get hold of the idea that Imeant to express; and as I want to leave a part of the page tilltomorrow morning, I will stop here
 God bless thee
 I think I shalldream of thee to night, for I never loved thee so much
Thy father, apparently, did not see fit to carry thy letter to theCustom-House; and yet I think my intuition informed me that a letterwas written; for I looked into the Desk very eagerly, although ColonelHall neither pointed with his finger nor glanced with his eye, as ishis custom when anything very precious is in store
 It reached me herein mine own tabernacle, about half an hour since, while I sat restingmyself from the toils of the day, thinking of thee, my Dove
Thou didst make me happier, last evening, than I ever hoped to be,save in Heaven--and still that same happiness is around me and withinme
 I am the happier for everything thou dost and sayest--thou canstnot possibly act so that I will not love thee better and be thehappier for that very individual action
Dearest, it was necessary that I should speak to thee to-night; butthou must not look for such a golden letter as thou didst write thismorning; for thy husband is tolerably weary, and has very few thoughtsin his mind, though much love in his heart
 I cannot do without thyvoice--thou knowest not what a sweet influence it has upon me, evenapart from the honied wisdom which thou utterest
 It thou shouldsttalk in an unknown tongue, I should listen with infinite satisfaction,and be much edified in spirit at least, if not in intellect
 When thouspeakest to me, there is mingled with those earthly words, which aremortal inventions, a far diviner language, which thy soul utters andmy soul understands
Ownest Dove, I did not choose to go to Malden this evening, to hearthe political lecture which I told thee of; for, indeed, after toilingall day, it is rather too hard to be bothered with such nonsense atnight
 I have no desire to go anywhither, after sunset, save to seemine own wife; and as to lectures, I love none but "curtainlectures";--for such I suppose thine may be termed, although ourbeloved so far hath no curtains
 Dearest, when we live together, thouwilt find me a most tediously stay-at-home husband
 Thou wilt becompelled to rebuke and objurgate me, in order to gain the privilegeof spending one or two evenings in a month by a solitary fireside
Sweetest wife, I must bid thee farewell now, exhorting thee to be ashappy as the angels; for thou art as good and holy as they, and havemore merit in thy goodness than they have; because the angels havealways dwelt in sinless heaven; whereas thy pilgrimage has been onearth, where many sin and go astray
 I am ashamed of this letter;there is nothing in it worthy of being offered to my Dove; but yet Ishall send it; for a letter to one's beloved wife ought not to be keptback for any dimness of thought or feebleness of expression, any morethan a prayer should be stifled in the soul, because the tongue of mancannot breathe it eloquently to the Deity
 Love has its ownomniscience; and what Love speaks to Love is comprehended in the sameway that prayers are
Ownest, dost thou not long very earnestly to see thy husband?Well--thou shalt see him on Monday night; and this very night he willcome into thy dreams, if thou wilt admit him there
Here sits thy husband in his old accustomed chamber, where he used tosit in years gone by, before his soul became acquainted with thine
Here I have written many tales--many that have been burned toashes--many that doubtless deserved the same fate
 This deserves to becalled a haunted chamber, for thousands upon thousands of visions haveappeared to me in it; and some few of them have become visible to theworld
 If ever I should have a biographer, he ought to make greatmention of this chamber in my memoirs, because so much of my lonelyyouth was wasted here, and here my mind and character were formed; andhere I have been glad and hopeful, and here I have been despondent;and here I sat a long, long time, waiting patiently for the world toknow me, and sometimes wondering why it did not know me sooner, orwhether it would ever know me at all--at least, till I were in mygrave
 And sometimes (for I had no wife then to keep my heart warm) itseemed as if I were already in the grave, with only life enough to bechilled and benumbed
 But oftener I was happy--at least, as happy as Ithen knew how to be, or was aware of the possibility of being
 By andbye, the world found me out in my lonely chamber, and called meforth--not, indeed, with a loud roar of acclamation, but rather with astill, small voice; and forth I went, but found nothing in the worldthat I thought preferable to my old solitude, till at length a certainDove was revealed to me, in the shadow of a seclusion as deep as myown had been
 And I drew nearer and nearer to the Dove, and opened mybosom to her, and she flitted into it, and closed her wings there--andthere she nestles now and forever, keeping my heart warm, and renewingmy life with her own
 So now I begin to understand why I wasimprisoned so many years in this lonely chamber, and why I could neverbreak through the viewless bolts and bars; for if I had sooner made myescape into the world, I should have grown hard and rough, and beencovered with earthly dust, and my heart would have become callous byrude encounters with the multitude; so that I should have been allunfit to shelter a heavenly Dove in my arms
 But living in solitudetill the fulness of time was come, I still kept the dew of my youthand the freshness of my heart, and had these to offer to my Dove
Well, dearest, I had no notion what I was going to write, when Ibegan, and indeed I doubted whether I should write anything at all;for after such communion as that of our last blissful evening, itseems as if a sheet of paper could only be a veil betwixt us
 Ownest,in the times that I have been speaking of, I used to think that Icould imagine all passions, all feelings, all states of the heart andmind; but how little did I know what it is to be mingled withanother's being! Thou only hast taught me that I have a heart--thouonly hast thrown a light deep downward, and upward, into my soul
 Thouonly hast revealed me to myself; for without thy aid, my bestknowledge of myself would have been merely to know my own shadow--towatch it flickering on the wall, and mistake its fantasies for my ownreal actions
 Indeed, we are but shadows--we are not endowed with reallife, and all that seems most real about us is but the thinnestsubstance of a dream--till the heart is touched
 That touch createsus--then we begin to be--thereby we are beings of reality, andinheritors of eternity
 Now, dearest, dost thou comprehend what thouhast done for me? And is it not a somewhat fearful thought, that a fewslight circumstances might have prevented us from meeting, and then Ishould have returned to my solitude, sooner or later (probably now,when I have thrown down my burthen of coal and salt) and never should[have] been created at all! But this is an idle speculation
 If thewhole world had stood between us, we must have met--if we had beenborn in different ages, we could not have been sundered
Belovedest, how dost thou do? If I mistake not, it was a southern rainyesterday, and, next to the sunshine of Paradise, that seems to bethy element
Never was a wife so yearned for as thou art
 I wonder how I could haveresolved to be absent from thee so long--it is far too long a time tobe wasted in a suspension of life
 My heart is sometimes faint forwant of thee--and sometimes it is violent and tumultuous for the samecause
 How is it with thine, mine ownest? Dost thou not feel, whenthou goest to bed, that the day is utterly incomplete?--that it hasbeen an unsatisfactory dream, wherein the soul groped wearily forsomething that it could not obtain? Thus it is with thy husband
What a history wilt thou have to tell me, when I come back! We shallbe a week in getting through it
 Poor little Dove, I pity thee now:for I apprehend that, by this time, thou hast got thy husband'sdullest of all books to read
 And how many pages canst thou read,without falling asleep? Well is it for thee, that thou hast adoptedthe practice of extending thyself on the sopha, while at thy studies;for now I need be under no apprehension of thy sinking out of a chair
I would, for thy sake, that thou couldst find anything laudable inthis awful little volume; because thou wouldst like to tell thyhusband that he has done well
Oh, this weather!--how dismal it is
 A sullen sky above, and mud and"slosh" below! Thy husband needs thy sunshine, thou cheerfullestlittle wife; for he is quite pervaded and imbued with the sullennessof all nature
 Thou knowest that his disposition is never the mostgracious in the world; but now he is absolutely intolerable
 The daysshould be all sunshine when he is away from thee; because, if therewere twenty suns in the unclouded sky, yet his most essential sunshinewould be wanting
 Well, there is one good in absence; it makes merealise more adequately how much I love thee--and what an infiniteportion of me thou art
 It makes me happy even to yearn and sigh forthee as I do; because I love to be conscious of our deep, indissolubleunion--and of the impossibility of living without thee
 There issomething good in me, else thou couldst not have become one with me,thou holy wife
 I shall be happy, because God has made my happinessnecessary to that of one whom He loves
 Thus is it that I reason withmyself; and therefore my soul rejoices to feel the intermingling ofour beings, even when it is felt in this longing desire for thee
Dearest, amongst my other reasons for wishing to be in , wouldstthou believe that I am eager to behold thy alabaster vase--and thelittle flower-vase, and thy two precious pictures? Even so it is
Thou, who art the loadstone of my soul, hast magnetised them,therefore they attract me
I met Frederic Howes last evening, and promised to go there to-night;although he seemed to think that Miss Burley will be in 
Perhaps thou wilt see her there
 I wonder if she will not come andsettle with us in Mr
 Ripley's Utopia
 And this reminds me to askwhether thou hast drawn those caricatures--especially the one of thyhusband, staggering, and puffing, and toiling onward to the gate ofthe farm, burthened with the unsaleable remnant of Grandfather'sChair
 Dear me, what a ponderous, leaden load it will be!Dearest, I am utterly ashamed of my handwriting
 I wonder how thoucanst anywise tolerate what is so ungraceful, being thyself all grace
But I think I seldom write so shamefully as in this epistle
 It is atoil and torment to write upon this sheet of paper; for it seems to begreasy, and feels very unpleasantly to the pen
 Moreover the penitself is very culpable
 Yet thou wouldst make the fairest, delicateststrokes upon the same paper, with the same pen
 Thou art beautifulthroughout, even to the minutest thing
Infinitely dearest, I went to the post office yesterday, after dinner,and inquiring for a letter, thy "visible silence" was put into myhands
 Canst thou remotely imagine how glad I was? Hast thou also beengladdened by an uncouth scribbling, which thy husband dispatched tothee on Monday? Oh, belovedest, no words can tell how thirsty myspirit is for thine! Surely I was very reprehensible to conceive theidea of spending a whole week and more away from thee
 Why didst thounot scold me? and go with me wherever I went? Without thee, I have butthe semblance of life
 All the world hereabouts seems dull anddrowsy--a vision, but without any spirituality--and I, likewise anunspiritual shadow, struggle vainly to catch hold of something real
Thou art my reality; and nothing else is real for me, unless thou giveit that golden quality by thy touch
Dearest, how camest thou by the headache? Thou shouldst have dreamedof thy husband's breast, instead of that Arabian execution; and thenthou wouldst have awaked with a very delicious thrill in thy heart,and no pain in thy head
 And what wilt thou do to-day, persecutedlittle Dove, when thy abiding-place will be a Babel of talkers? Wouldthat Miss Margaret Fuller might lose her tongue!--or my Dove her ears,and so be left wholly to her husband's golden silence! Dearest wife, Itruly think that we could dispense with audible speech, and yet neverfeel the want of an interpreter between our spirits
 We have soaredinto a region where we talk together in a language that can have noearthly echo
 Articulate words are a harsh clamor and dissonance
 Whenman arrives at his highest perfection, he will again be dumb!--for Isuppose he was dumb at the Creation, and must perform an entire circlein order to return to that blessed state
 Cousin Christopher, by thyaccount, seems to be of the same opinion, and is gradually learning totalk without the use of his voice
Jany
 15th
 Friday
--Oh, belovedest, what a weary week is this! Neverdid I experience the like
 I went to bed last night, positively dismaland comfortless
 Wilt thou know thy husband's face, when we meetagain? Art thou much changed by the flight of years, my poor littlewife? Is thy hair turned gray? Dost thou wear a day-cap, as well asa night cap? How long since didst thou begin to use spectacles?Perhaps thou wilt not like to have me see thee, now that Time has donehis worst to mar thy beauty; but fear thou not, sweetest Dove, forwhat I have loved and admired in thee is eternal
 I shall look throughthe envious mist of age, and discern thy immortal grace as perfectlyas in the light of Paradise
 As for thy husband, he is grown quitebald and gray, and has very deep wrinkles across his brow, andcrowsfeet and furrows all over his face
 His eyesight fails him, sothat he can only read the largest print in the broadest day-light; butit is a singular circumstance, that he makes out to decypher the pygmycharacters of thy epistles, even by the faintest twilight
 The secretis, that they are characters of light to him, so that he coulddoubtless read them in midnight darkness
 Art thou not glad,belovedest, that thou wast ordained to be a heavenly light to thyhusband, amid the dreary twilight of age?Grandfather is very anxious to know what has become of his chair, andthe Famous Old People who sat in it
 I tell him that it will probablyarrive in the course of to-day; and that he need not be so impatient;for the public will be very well content to wait, even were it tillDoomsday
 He acquiesces, but scolds, nevertheless
I saw thy cousin Mary Tappan yesterday, and felt the better for it,because she is connected with thee in my mind
 Dearest, I love theevery much!!!! Art thou not astonished? I wish to ask thee a question,but will reserve it for the extreme end of this letter
I trust that thou art quite well, belovedest
 That headache took avery unfair advantage, in attacking thee while thou wast away from thyhusband
 It is his province to guard thee both from head-ache andheart-ache; and thou performest the same blessed office for him, sofar as regards the heart-ache--as to the head-ache, he knows it not,probably because his head is like a block of wood
Now good-bye, dearest, sweetest, loveliest, holiest, truest,suitablest little wife
 I worship thee
 Thou art my type of womanlyperfection
 Thou keepest my heart pure, and elevatest me above theworld
 Thou enablest me to interpret the riddle of life, and fillestme with faith in the unseen and better land, because thou leadest methither continually
 God bless thee forever
Dost thou love me?Very dearest, what a dismal sky is this that hangs over us! Thyhusband doth but half live to-day--his soul lies asleep, or rathertorpid
 As for thee, thou hast been prating at a great rate, and hasspoken many wonderful truths in to-day's conversation
Belovedest, thou wast very sweet and lovely in our walk yesterdaymorning; and it gladdens me much that Providence brought us together
Dost thou not think that there is always some especial blessinggranted us, when we are to be divided for any length of time? Thourememberest what a blissful evening came down from Heaven to us,before our last separation; insomuch that our hearts glowed with itsinfluence, all through the ensuing week
 And yesterday there came aheavenly morning, and thou camest with it like a rosy vision, whichstill lingers with me, and will not quite fade away, till it be timefor it to brighten into reality
 Surely, thou art beloved of Heaven,and all these blessings are vouchsafed for thy sake; for I do notremember that such things used to happen to me, while I was a solitarysinner
 Thou bringest a rich portion to thy husband, dearest--even theblessing of thy Heavenly Father
Whenever I return to Salem, I feel how dark my life would be, withoutthe light that thou shedst upon it--how cold, without the warmth ofthy love
 Sitting in this chamber, where my youth wasted itself invain, I can partly estimate the change that has been wrought
 It seemsas it the better part of me had been born, since then
 I had walkedthose many years in darkness, and might so have walked through life,with only a dreamy notion that there was any light in the universe, ifthou hadst not kissed mine eye-lids, and given me to see
 Thou,belovedest, hast always been positively happy
 Not so thy husband--hehas only been not miserable
 Then which of us has gained the most? Thyhusband, assuredly
When a beam of heavenly sunshine incorporates itself with a darkcloud, is not the cloud benefitted more than the sunshine? What ahappy image is this!--my soul is the cloud, and thine thesunshine--but a gentler, sweeter sunshine than ever melted into anyother cloud
Dearest wife, nothing at all has happened to me, since I left thee
 Itpuzzles me to conceive how thou meetest with so many more events thanthy husband
 Thou wilt have a volume to tell me, when we meet, andwilt pour thy beloved voice into mine ears, in a stream of two hours'long
 At length thou wilt pause, and say--"But what has thy lifebeen?"--and then will thy stupid husband look back upon what he callshis life, for three or four days past, and behold a blank! Thou livestten times as much [as] he; because thy spirit takes so much more noteof things
I met our friend Mr
 Howes in the street, yesterday, and held a briefconfabulation
 He did not inquire how my wife's health is
 Was notthis a sin against etiquette? Dearest, thy husband's stupid book seemsto meet more approbation here, than the former volume did--thoughthat was greeted more favorably than it deserved
 There is asuperfluity of newspaper puffs here, and a deficiency in , wherethey are much needed
 I ought to love Salem better than I do; for thepeople have always had a pretty generous faith in me, ever since theyknew me at all
 I fear I must be undeserving of their praise, else Ishould never get it
 What an ungrateful blockhead thy husband is!
